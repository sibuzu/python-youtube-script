copeland曲线交易策略是一种基于动量的方法，旨在通过将两个RSI指标与加权移动平均线相结合，旨在确定股票市场的长期趋势。 这是该策略的结构化摘要：

1. **指标计算** ：
   - The Copeland Curve is calculated as a weighted moving average of the 10-period and 20-period Relative Strength Index (RSI). This combination aims to blend short-term volatility with medium-term momentum.

2. **客观的** ：
   - The strategy seeks to capture sustained trends by smoothing out RSI signals, potentially offering more reliable buy/sell indicators than using a single RSI period.

3. **表现** ：
   - Since 2012, the strategy has delivered an average annual return of approximately 6.11%, suggesting historical profitability in long-term trend trading.

4. **交易信号** ：
   - The strategy likely generates signals based on the Copeland Curve crossing above or below certain thresholds, indicating upward or downward trends.

5. **优势** ：
   - Combines two RSIs to reduce conflicting signals and provides a balanced approach by considering both short-term and medium-term momentum.
   -通过加权平均，与仅使用一个RSI相比，通过加权平均进行平衡，可能导致信号较小。

6. **考虑因素** ：
   - The choice of weights for each RSI period is crucial and could impact performance.
   - Potential drawdowns during market corrections require robust risk management.
   - Historical performance does not guarantee future results; forward testing is advisable.
   - Transaction costs and slippage should be factored into expected returns.

总之，Copeland Curve策略通过将两个RSI指标与加权平均整合在一起，提供了一种独特的趋势跟踪方法。 尽管它显示出历史效果，但仔细考虑参数，市场状况和风险管理对于成功实施至关重要。
