所讨论的交易策略旨在用于容易出价的资产，例如比特币。 这是一个结构化的摘要：

1. **进入信号** ：
   - The strategy involves buying an asset when its closing price sets a new 25-day high. This indicates a potential upward trend or momentum.

2. **退出信号** ：
   - The exit condition is less clear in the description but likely involves selling when the price drops below a certain threshold relative to the entry point (e.g., a percentage decrease from the 25-day high). Possible methods include trailing stops, moving averages, or technical indicators like RSI.

3. **表现** ：
   - The strategy resulted in an impressive return, growing $100k to $3.6 million in under four years, suggesting significant compounding and volatility exploitation.

4. **考虑因素** ：
   - Potential risks include entering at resistance levels and facing drawdowns during market corrections.
   - The strategy may involve trend-following, which is effective in trending markets but risky in mean-reverting ones.
   - Transaction costs could impact returns, especially with frequent trading.

5. **评估需求** ：
   - Further details on exit criteria and backtesting performance through different market cycles (e.g., crashes) would be beneficial to assess risk and viability.

总而言之，该战略旨在通过进入新的高点并根据预定义的较低价格水平退出来利用价格峰值，提供高回报，但具有相关风险。
