所讨论的交易策略采用相对强度指数（RSI）作为技术指标来确定潜在的买卖机会。 这是分析的有组织摘要：

1. **策略概述** ：
   - The strategy involves buying assets when RSI falls below 15 (indicating oversold conditions) and selling when it rises above 20 (overbought conditions). This approach aims to capitalize on short-term price reversals.

2. **RSI阈值** ：
   - Using thresholds of 15 for buying and 20 for selling is more aggressive than the standard RSI levels (typically 30 for oversold and 70 for overbought), suggesting a focus on more extreme market conditions to enter trades.

3. **性能指标** ：
   - Annual returns are reported at 4.2%, which is modest, but the risk-adjusted return is noted as 37%. This high figure may indicate a strong Sharpe ratio, though verification of the calculation method is recommended.

4. **潜在问题和考虑因素** ：
   - **假信号** ：频繁的RSI波动可能导致许多具有有限利润潜力的交易。
   - **交易成本** ：高交易频率可能会增加成本，从而影响整体回报。
   - **时间范围和资产特异性** ：该策略的有效性可能取决于用于RSI计算的时间范围（例如14天与较短的时期）和资产类别。

5. **市场状况** ：
   - The strategy's reliance on short-term price reversals might not perform well during trending markets, where RSI could lead to frequent whipsaws.

6. **进行回测和现实应用程序** ：
   - Without specific backtesting details, it's uncertain if the strategy holds up in various market conditions.
   - Costs associated with frequent trading, including commissions and slippage, should be carefully considered.

7. **替代方法** ：
   - Enhancing the strategy with additional indicators or techniques, such as divergence analysis or waiting for pullbacks, might improve its effectiveness.

总而言之，尽管基于RSI的策略为短期交易提供了一种直接的方法，但其成功取决于几个因素，包括交易成本，市场状况和彻底的回测。 潜在交易者应在实施该战略之前评估这些方面。
