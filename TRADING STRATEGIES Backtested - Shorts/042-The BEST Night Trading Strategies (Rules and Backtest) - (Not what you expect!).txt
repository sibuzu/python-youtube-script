[00:02] are you interested in learning how you
[00:04] can make money in the stock market with
[00:05] minimal effort well you'll be surprised
[00:08] to find out that practically all the
[00:09] gains in the S P 500 over the last 30
[00:12] years have come overnight that's right
[00:14] from 1993 until today the average gain
[00:17] of holding the S P 500 from the close
[00:19] until tomorrow's open is 0.04 percent
[00:24] but why is there an overnight bias in
[00:26] the market the reason is most likely due
[00:29] to inflation and earnings growth over
[00:30] time not only that but you get a reward
[00:33] for taking the added risk of holding
[00:35] overnight
[00:36] and if your data in stocks turns out
[00:39] that you can't get any help from any
[00:40] long-term trends only in stocks that's
[00:42] because for the last 30 years you have
[00:45] lost money by buying the open and
[00:46] selling the clothes every day
[00:49] so if you're looking for an easy way to
[00:51] make money in the stock market why not
[00:53] try taking advantage of the overnight
[00:56] trend
