[00:00] the five main asset classes are stocks
[00:02] bonds gold real estate and cash we see
[00:06] that even by decades the main asset
[00:08] classes vary a lot in performance the
[00:11] blue line on the screen shows the
[00:13] three-year annual returns and it's
[00:15] clearly a lot more erratic and volatile
[00:17] than the yellow line which shows the
[00:18] 10year annual returns clearly if you
[00:21] invested $100 in 1928 we see that stocks
[00:25] outclass bonds gold real estate and cash
[00:29] because the chart is logarithmic the
[00:31] enormous differences don't show as well
[00:33] so let's summarize the findings in a
[00:35] table $100 invested in the stock market
[00:39] in 1928 would have been worth 787 th000
[00:42] today compared to only 10,000 for gold
[00:45] the second best performing asset
