[00:00] this one's slightly more complicated and
[00:02] involves three ETFs
[00:04] the strategy was developed by the famous
[00:06] podcaster and money manager Meb Faber
[00:09] and published around 2015. it's a
[00:11] momentum rotation strategy for stocks
[00:13] bonds and gold that uses monthly bars we
[00:17] use the following ETFs spy for S P 500
[00:20] GLD for gold and TLT for bonds
[00:24] at the end of the month we invest or
[00:26] stay long when the three-month simple
[00:28] moving average is above the 10-month
[00:30] moving average we allocate one third of
[00:33] our Capital to each ETF for example if
[00:35] we get a signal in two ETFs we invest 66
[00:39] percent of our equity and stay 33
[00:41] percent in cash
[00:43] let's back test the strategy the
[00:45] strategy worked really well until 2015
[00:48] when the strategy was published but
[00:50] since then it's not performed so well
[00:52] the annual return is almost eight
[00:54] percent and Max drawdown is modest at
[00:56] only 18 percent
