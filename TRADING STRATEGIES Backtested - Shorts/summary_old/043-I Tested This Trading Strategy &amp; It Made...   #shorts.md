This trading strategy involves entering a long position in SPY (an ETF that tracks the S&P 500) at the close of the last trading day of a month and exiting the position at the close of the first trading day of the next month. The strategy is based on the observation that the first trading day of a new month tends to perform better than random days, with an average gain of 0.25% per trade. Additionally, there is a high probability that the trade will be profitable on the first attempt, making it a potentially reliable and simple approach for traders looking to capitalize on monthly market patterns.
