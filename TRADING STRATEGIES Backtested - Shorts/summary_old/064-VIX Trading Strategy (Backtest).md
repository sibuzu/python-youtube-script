The trading strategy summarized uses the VIX index, known as the "fear index," which measures implied volatility in options on the S&P 500. The strategy involves:

1. Using the VIX compared to its 20-day moving average.
2. When the VIX is above this average (indicating high fear), the S&P 500's average daily return drops to 0.3%.
3. When the VIX is below this average (low fear), returns increase to 0.5%.

This suggests trading based on fear levels, potentially avoiding or reducing exposure when fear is high.
