**Summary of Small-Cap Value Trading Strategy**

1. **Small-Cap Effect Overview**: The small-cap effect, or small-cap premium, highlights that smaller companies tend to outperform larger ones over the long term. This phenomenon is integral to the Fama French Three Factor Model, which explains stock returns through size, value, and momentum factors.

2. **Historical Context**: Since 1940, small-cap value stocks have demonstrated superior performance compared to small-cap growth stocks. Historical data shows a $100 investment in small-cap value stocks grew to $276,000 by 2023, significantly outpacing the S&P 500's growth of $38,000 over the same period.

3. **Strategy Components**:
   - **Target Market Cap**: Focus on companies with a market capitalization under $1 billion.
   - **Financial Health**: Invest in firms exhibiting a positive return on equity (ROE) over the past five years to ensure financial stability.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose between individual high-quality small-cap stocks or ETFs tracking a small-cap value index for flexibility.

4. **Performance Example**: The strategy's effectiveness is underscored by historical returns, illustrating potential benefits of focusing on smaller, financially healthy companies.

This strategy emphasizes both size and quality, offering investors a structured approach to capitalize on the small-cap premium.
