The Super Trend indicator is a trend-following tool designed to identify potential buy and sell signals based on price action relative to a dynamic band. Here's a concise summary of the trading strategy:

1. **Indicator Construction**: The Super Trend indicator is calculated by adding and subtracting the Average True Range (ATR) from a median price over a specified period. This creates an upper and lower boundary around the price.

2. **Entry Rules**:
   - **Buy Signal**: Enter a long position when the price breaks above the upper band of the Super Trend indicator.
   
3. **Exit Rules**:
   - **Sell Signal**: Exit the trade (close the long position) when the price closes below the lower band of the Super Trend indicator.

4. **Risk Management**: Proper risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders, are essential to protect capital during unfavorable market movements.

5. **Performance Example**: An investment of $100,000 in the 1960s, hypothetically managed using this strategy, could grow to approximately $4 million today, showcasing its potential effectiveness over time.

This strategy aims to capitalize on trending markets by leveraging the dynamic nature of the Super Trend indicator.
