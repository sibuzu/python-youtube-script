The trading strategy described suggests taking action based on historical market reactions to major conflicts. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Historical Context**: Markets often anticipate and factor in the impact of wars or significant geopolitical events before they occur, as seen with the U.S. stock decline prior to Pearl Harbor.

2. **Strategy Advice**:
   - **Buy when markets react negatively to a conflict** (e.g., buy during market declines triggered by war sounds).
   - **Sell when markets rally excessively** (e.g., sell after the rally following a conflict).

3. **Rationale**: The strategy is based on the idea that conflicts are often priced in before they happen, and markets may overreact initially, leading to potential buying opportunities when prices dip or selling opportunities during excessive rallies.

4. **Motto**: "Buy to the sound of cannons, sell to the sound of trumpets," emphasizing timing trades based on market reactions to events rather than directly reacting to conflicts themselves.

This approach encourages traders to consider historical patterns and market psychology in their decision-making.
