The trading strategy involves using the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) indicator to identify potential trend reversals and extreme market conditions. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Indicator Overview**: The CCI measures a security's price level relative to an average price over a specified period, acting as a momentum oscillator.

2. **Entry Signal**: A buy signal is triggered when the CCI drops below -90, indicating oversold conditions.

3. **Exit Signal**: A sell signal occurs when the closing price exceeds yesterday's high by 100,000 units (contextually mentioned in the example).

4. **Performance Example**: This strategy has demonstrated significant returns, multiplying equity tenfold over a period, as illustrated by the 1993 example.

This approach leverages technical analysis to capitalize on market trends and reversals using CCI for entry points and custom price targets for exits.
