Larry Connors' strategy involves buying when the close is above the 200-day moving average, below the 5-day moving average, and has dropped at least four of the last five days. Selling occurs when the close exceeds yesterday's high. The S&P 500 equity curve shows upward growth with an average gain per trade of 0.55% and a 4% annual return. The strategy is active only 10% of the time, using the 200-day moving average to ensure a bullish environment. Its maximum drawdown is 13%, lower than typical trend-following strategies, making it suitable for both day trading and swing trading.
