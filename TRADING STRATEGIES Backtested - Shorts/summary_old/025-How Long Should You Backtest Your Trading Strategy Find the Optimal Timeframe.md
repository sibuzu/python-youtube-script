The trading strategy outlined emphasizes the importance of thorough backtesting to ensure robust and reliable results. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Backtest Duration**: 
   - Swing strategies should be backtested over at least 10 years to capture various market conditions, including bull markets, bear markets, and corrections.
   - The duration may vary based on the strategy's time frame: shorter for day trading, longer for long-term strategies.

2. **Trade Count**:
   - Ensure a significant number of trades are included in the backtest to avoid results being influenced by random fluctuations.
   - Focus on both the length of time and the number of observations to validate the strategy effectively.

This approach helps traders build a well-rounded understanding of their strategy's performance across different market scenarios, reducing reliance on anecdotal evidence and improving confidence in the strategy's reliability.
