**Swing Trading Strategy Summary**

The strategy outlined is a swing trading approach focused on potentially short positions in the S&P 500. Here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Entry Conditions:**
   - The S&P 500 index closes at a new low for the past five days.
   - The IBS (indicator behavior unknown, but assumed to be related to momentum or volume) is below .25.

2. **Exit Condition:**
   - Sell and close the short position when the closing price exceeds yesterday's high.

This strategy aims to capitalize on potential short-term corrections after a downward movement, using technical indicators to filter entry and exit points. The strategy suggests initiating a short trade under specific bearish conditions and exiting upon a upward price move relative to the previous day's high.
