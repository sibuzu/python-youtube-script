The Rubber Band Trading Strategy is a mean reversion approach that leverages the belief that asset prices will回归their historical average after deviating. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Mean Reversion Principle**: The strategy assumes that prices fluctuate around an average and will eventually return to it, allowing traders to buy at lower prices (weakness) and sell at higher prices (strength).

2. **Mechanism**: Investors buy assets when they are undervalued (low price) expecting a rebound, and sell when overvalued (high price), anticipating a correction.

3. **Performance**: A $100,000 investment in 1993 grew to $870,000 by 2022, yielding an annual return of 7.4% with dividends included. This growth is attributed to compounding over nearly three decades.

4. **Considerations**:
   - **Risks**: Includes the challenge of timing and the possibility that prices may not revert quickly.
   - **Components**: Considers both capital gains and dividend income for total return.
   - **Application**: Best suited for assets like stocks, ETFs, or commodities, and requires a long-term perspective with potential for frequent trading adjustments.

5. **Conclusion**: The strategy is patient, systematic, and aims for steady, compounded returns over time by exploiting market reversion to the mean.
