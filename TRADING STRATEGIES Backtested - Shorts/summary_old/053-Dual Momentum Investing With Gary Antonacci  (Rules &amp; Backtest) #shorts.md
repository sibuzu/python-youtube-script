**Summary of Gary Antonacci's Dual Momentum Strategy:**

Gary Antonacci's Dual Momentum strategy, detailed in his book "Dual Momentum Investing," involves a dynamic allocation approach across selected ETFs to capitalize on market momentum. The strategy is designed to shift allocations monthly based on each asset's relative performance against cash, aiming to maximize returns while minimizing risk during downturns.

**Key Components:**
1. **Assets Involves:** The strategy typically includes SPY (S&P 500), EFA (International equities), and potentially AG (which could be another ETF or alternative asset like gold).
2. **Rebalancing Frequency:** Monthly, ensuring the portfolio is adjusted based on current momentum trends.
3. **Allocation Methodology:** Assets are allocated proportionally to their relative performance. The asset with the strongest momentum receives the largest allocation, while others may receive smaller allocations or none if they underperform cash.

**Performance:**
- A $100,000 investment in 2004 grew to approximately $328,000 by 2019, indicating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 7%, which is consistent with effective momentum strategy performance.

**Considerations:**
- While the historical performance is strong, future results may vary.
- The strategy includes holding cash when no asset demonstrates positive momentum, aiming to preserve capital during unfavorable market conditions.

This approach offers a balanced risk-reward profile by leveraging momentum dynamics across diverse assets, providing a systematic yet flexible investment method.
