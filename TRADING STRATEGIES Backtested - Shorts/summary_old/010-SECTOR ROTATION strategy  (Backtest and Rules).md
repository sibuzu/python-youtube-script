**Sector Rotation Trading Strategy Summary**

The sector rotation strategy involves systematically switching investments between different asset classes or ETFs based on their recent performance. Utilizing four specific ETFs—SPY (S&P 500), TLT (long-term Treasury bonds), EFA (international equities), and EEM (emerging markets)—the approach ranks these ETFs monthly according to the previous month's performance. The investor then allocates to the top-performing ETF for a holding period of one month, repeating this process each month.
