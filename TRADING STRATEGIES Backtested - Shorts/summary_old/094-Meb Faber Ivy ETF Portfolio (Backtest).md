The trading strategy outlined in "Ivy Portfolio" by Meb Faber and Eric W Richardson aims to replicate the performance of Ivy League university endowments, such as Yale's, through a diversified approach using ETFs. The portfolio consists of five equally weighted ETFs (each allocated 20%), designed to mirror the diversification seen in institutional investments, including exposure to commodities, real estate, and other alternative assets. 

The strategy has delivered an annual return of 4.6%, which is below historical averages due to poor commodity performance. This approach is suitable for long-term investors seeking accessible diversification akin to institutional portfolios, but it's important to note that its returns are closely tied to commodity prices, which can be volatile and may impact overall performance.
