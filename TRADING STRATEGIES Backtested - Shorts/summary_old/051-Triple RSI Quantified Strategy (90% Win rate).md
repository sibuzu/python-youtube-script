The Triple RSI trading strategy, named for its reliance on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), aims to capitalize on pullbacks within long-term rising trends in the stock market. Here's a concise summary of the strategy:

1. **Entry Conditions**:
   - The 5-day RSI must be below 30.
   - The RSI must have declined for three consecutive days.
   - The RSI reading three days prior was below 60.

2. **Performance**:
   - Since its implementation from 1993 to the present, it has generated only 83 trades.
   - It boasts an impressive win rate of 90%, with the average gain per trade being nearly 1.4%.

This strategy is designed to exploit market pullbacks within uptrends, leveraging the RSI indicator to identify potential buying opportunities during periods of perceived weakness in an otherwise rising trend.
