The trading strategy involves exploiting the difference between a closed-end fund's price and its net asset value (NAV). Here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Indicator Used**: The strategy tracks the relative strength index (RSI) of the price-to-NAV ratio over two days.

2. **Entry Signal**: A long position is taken when this RSI crosses below 10, indicating an oversold condition in the price-to-NAV ratio.

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Number of Trades**: 212
   - **Average Gain per Trade**: 48%
   - **Maximum Drawdown**: 67%

This strategy leverages momentum indicators to capitalize on potential undervaluation, offering high returns but with significant risk due to the substantial drawdown.
