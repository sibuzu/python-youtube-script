The Fabian Timing Model, developed by Richard Fabian in the 1960s, is a quantitative, long-term trend-following strategy. It involves monitoring three major indices, including the S&P 500, to determine if they are above their respective 39-week moving averages. When all three indices meet this condition, the model suggests investing in them. Since 2000, this approach has outperformed the S&P 500 by a significant margin, highlighting its effectiveness as a systematic, trend-based strategy.
