   - **Buy Signal**: When the PMI reading is above 50 at the start of the month.
   - **Sell Signal**: Sell at the open of the next month.
3. **Holding Period**: Positions are typically held for one month.
4. **Performance**:
   - The strategy is active **72% of the time**, indicating that it does not hold positions during all months.
   - It achieves an **annualized return of 7.3%**.
5. **Key Benefits**:
