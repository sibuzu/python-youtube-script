The trading strategy discussed involves two approaches based on the inverted yield curve, a phenomenon where short-term interest rates are higher than long-term rates, often signaling an impending economic recession. Here's a concise summary of the strategy:

1. **Buy and Hold Approach**:
   - When the yield curve inverts, buy the S&P 500 index.
   - Hold the investment for either 250 or 500 days.
   - Since 1976, this approach has yielded an average gain of 7.35% over 250 days and 18.3% over 500 days, which is comparable to a long-term buy-and-hold strategy.

2. **RSI-Based Approach**:
   - Use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the yield curve.
   - Buy when the RSI reaches oversold levels (below 20) and sell when it reaches overbought levels (above 80).
   - Since 1976, this strategy has resulted in 102 trades with an average gain of 2.5% per trade.

Both strategies aim to capitalize on market conditions indicated by the inverted yield curve. For more details or additional strategies, visit [quantifiedstrategies.com](https://quantifiedstrategies.com).
