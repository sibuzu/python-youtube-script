The Copeland Curve trading strategy is a momentum-based approach designed to identify long-term trends in the stock market by combining two RSI indicators with a weighted moving average. Here's a structured summary of the strategy:

1. **Indicator Calculation**:
   - The Copeland Curve is calculated as a weighted moving average of the 10-period and 20-period Relative Strength Index (RSI). This combination aims to blend short-term volatility with medium-term momentum.

2. **Objective**:
   - The strategy seeks to capture sustained trends by smoothing out RSI signals, potentially offering more reliable buy/sell indicators than using a single RSI period.

3. **Performance**:
   - Since 2012, the strategy has delivered an average annual return of approximately 6.11%, suggesting historical profitability in long-term trend trading.

4. **Trading Signals**:
   - The strategy likely generates signals based on the Copeland Curve crossing above or below certain thresholds, indicating upward or downward trends.

5. **Advantages**:
   - Combines two RSIs to reduce conflicting signals and provides a balanced approach by considering both short-term and medium-term momentum.
   - Smooths out volatility through weighted averaging, potentially leading to less erratic signals compared to using one RSI alone.

6. **Considerations**:
   - The choice of weights for each RSI period is crucial and could impact performance.
   - Potential drawdowns during market corrections require robust risk management.
   - Historical performance does not guarantee future results; forward testing is advisable.
   - Transaction costs and slippage should be factored into expected returns.

In conclusion, the Copeland Curve strategy offers a unique approach to trend-following by integrating two RSI indicators with weighted averaging. While it shows historical effectiveness, careful consideration of parameters, market conditions, and risk management is essential for successful implementation.
