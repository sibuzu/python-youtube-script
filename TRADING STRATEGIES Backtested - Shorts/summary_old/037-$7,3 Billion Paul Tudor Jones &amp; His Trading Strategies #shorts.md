Paul Tudor Jones employs a multifaceted trading strategy centered on technical analysis and an understanding of market psychology. A key tool in his approach is the 200-day moving average, which he uses to identify trends and time entries/exits effectively. While this method slightly underperforms compared to a buy-and-hold strategy on the S&P 500, it offers lower volatility and stress. Jones also engages in global macro trading, positioning himself in international markets based on broader societal and governmental shifts. He practices active management, continuously assessing his portfolio to divest from underperforming assets and invest in more promising ones, ensuring a dynamic and responsive investment strategy.
