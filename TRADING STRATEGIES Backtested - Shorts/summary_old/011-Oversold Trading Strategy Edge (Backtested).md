The trading strategy in question is based on the principle of mean reversion, which suggests that asset prices will eventually return to their historical average after periods of extreme volatility or overreaction. Here's a summary of the strategy:

1. **Oversold Market**: The strategy defines an oversold market as one where prices have been falling for an extended period, whether days, weeks, or months.

2. **Entry Signal**: Traders enter the market (buy) when the 3-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is below 20. The RSI is a technical indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to determine overbought or oversold conditions. A value below 20 indicates an oversold condition.

3. **Exit Signal**: Traders exit the market (sell) when the closing price is higher than yesterday's high. This suggests that prices have reversed their downward trend and are moving upwards.

4. **Performance**: The strategy claims to show steady upward growth in equity, with a hypothetical example of growing from $10,000 to $1.3 million during the period. While impressive, it's important to note that such results may not be representative of real-world performance due to factors like transaction costs, slippage, and market conditions.

### Key Points:
- The strategy is simple but relies heavily on technical indicators.
- It assumes that markets will revert to their mean after being oversold.
- The use of RSI as an entry signal can help identify potential buying opportunities when prices are undervalued due to recent declines.
- The exit signal based on closing prices relative to the previous day's high aims to capture upward momentum.

### Considerations:
- **Risk Management**: The strategy does not explicitly mention risk management techniques like stop-loss orders, which are crucial in limiting potential losses.
- **Market Conditions**: The effectiveness of the strategy may vary depending on market conditions and can be tested during different time periods to assess its robustness.
- **Execution Costs**: In real trading, transaction costs and slippage can significantly impact returns, especially for strategies that require frequent trades.

Overall, while the strategy appears straightforward and claims strong performance, it's essential to backtest it with historical data and consider additional risk management measures before implementing it in a live trading environment.
