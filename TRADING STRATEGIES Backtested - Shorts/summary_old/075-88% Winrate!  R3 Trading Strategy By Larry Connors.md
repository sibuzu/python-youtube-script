The R3 trading strategy leverages the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify potential sell points in a bullish market. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Entry Condition**: The closing price must be above the 200-day moving average to confirm a bullish trend.
2. **Sell Signal**:
   - The two-day RSI must have decreased for three consecutive days.
   - Today's two-day RSI must be below 20.
3. **Exit Signal**: Sell when the two-day RSI rises above 70.

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Trades**: 94
- **Win Rate**: 88%
- **Average Gain per Trade**: 1.16%
- **Market Exposure**: 4.57% (spending 95.43% of time in cash)

This strategy is designed for a conservative approach, allowing for minimal market exposure while capitalizing on strong sell signals with high profitability and a low number of losing trades.
