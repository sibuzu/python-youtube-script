The trading strategy described is designed to capture long-term trends by using 100-day high and low closing prices as entry and exit signals. Here's a concise summary of the strategy:

1. **Entry Signal**: When the closing price crosses above the highest closing price of the past 100 days, the strategy goes long (buys) at the close.
2. **Exit Signal**: When the closing price drops below the lowest closing price of the past 100 days, the strategy sells its position.
3. **Performance Claim**: Starting with $100,000, the strategy is purported to grow to $5.5 million over 60 years, implying an annualized return of approximately 12.8%.

### Key Considerations:
- **Simplicity and Effectiveness**: The strategy uses straightforward technical indicators but may generate false signals during market fluctuations.
- **Risk Management**: By exiting at the 100-day low, it aims to limit losses but might miss recoveries if prices rebound after a drop.
- **Market Conditions**: Its effectiveness may vary across different asset classes and economic periods.
- **Transaction Costs**: Over time, even small fees could impact profitability, necessitating cost-efficient trading mechanisms.
- **Implementation**: Likely automatable with algorithms, allowing for long-term execution without manual oversight.
- **Realism of Returns**: Achieving such high returns is impressive compared to typical market norms, suggesting potential use of leverage or optimal conditions.

This strategy highlights the importance of trend-following and compounding growth but requires careful consideration of its limitations and assumptions.
