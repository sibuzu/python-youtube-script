The trading strategy outlined emphasizes two key components for success:

1. **Positive Statistical Expectancy**: This involves developing a strategy based on historical data through backtesting. While past performance isn't a guarantee of future results, it's considered a solid starting point. A positive expectancy suggests that, over time, the strategy is likely to generate profits.

2. **Discipline and adherence to the plan**: It's crucial to stick to the strategy, even when the market challenges your positions. Emotional decisions, such as exiting trades early or taking excessive risks, can undermine long-term success.

In summary, the strategy focuses on having a well-tested approach with a proven edge and maintaining strict discipline in executing it.
