**Summary:**

The trading strategy leverages the superstition surrounding Friday the 13th by taking a contrarian approach in the stock market. Based on historical S&P 500 data since 1960, which shows that Friday the 13ths are not particularly unlucky or erratic compared to other Fridays, the strategy involves:

1. **Entry Signal**: Going long (buying) on the S&P 500 index futures or ETFs on a Friday that is the 13th of a month.
2. **Exit Signal**: Holding the position until the market close on the same day.
3. **Risk Management**: Using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and rolling positions if necessary.

The rationale is that, historically, the average gain on Friday the 13ths has been slightly better than or comparable to other Fridays, suggesting no inherent bad luck in the stock market on those days.
