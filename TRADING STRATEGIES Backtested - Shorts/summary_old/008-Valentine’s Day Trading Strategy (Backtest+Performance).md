The trading strategy capitalizes on the historical tendency of markets to experience abnormal positive returns around Valentine's Day (February 14th). Hereâ€™s a concise summary:

1. **Entry Signal**: Enter long positions in February when the calendar day is the 10th or later.
2. **Exit Signal**: Exit the trade at the close on February 14th, or the first trading day after if February 14th is not a trading day.
3. **Performance**: The strategy has shown an average gain of approximately 0.35% per trade over about three trading days, with an upward equity curve in the S&P 500 since 1960.

This approach leverages the Valentine's Day rally phenomenon to capture potential market gains during this period.
