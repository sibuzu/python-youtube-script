Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the trading strategy:

The **Money Flow Index (MFI)** is a momentum indicator that measures the flow of money into or out of a security. The strategy involves the following steps:

1. **Entry Signal**: 
   - Buy at the close when the two-day MFI is below 10. This indicates low buying pressure and potential undervaluation.

2. **Exit Signal**:
   - Sell at the close if the current day's high exceeds yesterday's high, signaling upward momentum and a potential price reversal.

3. **Performance**:
   - Backtesting results show that with this strategy, $100,000 in 1993 could grow to over $2 million by 1997 and over $4.5 million by 2000.

This approach aims to capitalize on low buying pressure followed by a strong upward move.
