The trading strategy you're referring to is based on a seasonal effect known as the "Turn of the Month" strategy. Here's a concise summary:

- **Buy Signal**: Enter a long position on the fifth trading day of the month.
- **Sell Signal**: Exit the trade and go flat (or take a short position) on the third trading day after the new moon, which typically corresponds to the later part of the month.

This strategy has been noted for capturing all the gains in the S&P 500 since 1960, suggesting it leverages significant market patterns during these specific time frames.
