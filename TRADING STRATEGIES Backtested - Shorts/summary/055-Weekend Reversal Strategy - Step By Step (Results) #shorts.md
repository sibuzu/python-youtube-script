The trading strategy described is called the "Turnaround Tuesday" strategy, which has been effective in the stock market for decades. Here's a summary of the strategy:

1. **Entry Signal**: 
   - On a Monday, if the closing price of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is lower than its price on the previous Friday, it triggers the entry signal.
   - This assumes that Friday was the last trading day before Monday.

2. **Buy Point**:
   - Investors buy SPY at the close of trading on such a Monday.

3. **Exit Signal**:
   - The exit occurs either on Tuesday if SPY closes higher than its previous day's (Monday's) high, or after five trading days, whichever comes first.
   - This means the holding period is either one day (Tuesday exit) or up to five days.

4. **Rationale**:
   - The strategy aims to capitalize on short-term price movements following a downclose on Monday, with the expectation that SPY will rally by Tuesday or within five days.
   - It suggests that this approach has historically been profitable, as demonstrated by the example where $100,000 invested in SPY using this strategy grew to nearly $2.2 million over time.

This strategy appears to be a short-term trading approach, potentially leveraging market momentum and mean-reversion principles. However, it's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results, and any investment strategy should be carefully considered with regard to individual risk tolerance and market conditions.
