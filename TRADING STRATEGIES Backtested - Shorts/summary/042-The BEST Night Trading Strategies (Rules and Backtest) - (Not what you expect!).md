The trading strategy outlined focuses on leveraging the overnight bias observed in the S&P 500 over the past 30 years. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Overnight Gains**: The strategy highlights that the majority of gains in the S&P 500 have occurred overnight, with an average gain of 0.04% from market close to the next day's open.

2. **Reason for Overnight Bias**: This trend is attributed to factors like inflation and earnings growth, which provide a reward for holding stocks overnight despite added risks.

3. **Contrarian Approach**: The strategy suggests avoiding short-term trading (buying at open and selling at close) as it has historically led to losses. Instead, it advocates for holding positions overnight to capture the upward drift.

4. **Low Effort**: This approach requires minimal effort compared to active trading or market timing, making it appealing for those seeking an easy way to participate in stock market gains.

Overall, the strategy emphasizes a passive, hold-and-wait approach to capitalize on the market's tendency to rise overnight, rather than engaging in daily trading.
