The trading strategy in question is designed for assets prone to significant price spikes, such as Bitcoin. Here's a structured summary:

1. **Entry Signal**: 
   - The strategy involves buying an asset when its closing price sets a new 25-day high. This indicates a potential upward trend or momentum.

2. **Exit Signal**:
   - The exit condition is less clear in the description but likely involves selling when the price drops below a certain threshold relative to the entry point (e.g., a percentage decrease from the 25-day high). Possible methods include trailing stops, moving averages, or technical indicators like RSI.

3. **Performance**:
   - The strategy resulted in an impressive return, growing $100k to $3.6 million in under four years, suggesting significant compounding and volatility exploitation.

4. **Considerations**:
   - Potential risks include entering at resistance levels and facing drawdowns during market corrections.
   - The strategy may involve trend-following, which is effective in trending markets but risky in mean-reverting ones.
   - Transaction costs could impact returns, especially with frequent trading.

5. **Evaluation Needs**:
   - Further details on exit criteria and backtesting performance through different market cycles (e.g., crashes) would be beneficial to assess risk and viability.

In summary, the strategy aims to capitalize on price spikes by entering at new highs and exiting based on predefined lower price levels, offering high returns but with associated risks.
