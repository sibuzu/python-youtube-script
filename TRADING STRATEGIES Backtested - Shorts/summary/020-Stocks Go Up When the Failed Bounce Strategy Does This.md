The trading strategy discussed is called the "Failed Bounce Trading Strategy." Here's a summary of its key components:

1. **Entry Conditions**:
   - Yesterday's Internal Bar Strength (IBS) was at least 0.6 or higher.
   - Yesterday's low is lower than the lowest low during the previous five days.

2. **Exit Condition**:
   - Exit when today's close is higher than yesterday's high.

3. **Trade Execution**:
   - Buy on short-term pullbacks and sell on strength.

4. **Performance**:
   - The strategy has been tested on several assets, including Pepsi Cola (with an equity curve since 1976), the XLP ETF tracking consumer staples, and the QQQ (Nasdaq-100 tracker).
   - The best performance is seen with QQQ, averaging a 1% return per trade.

This strategy appears to focus on identifyingFailed Bounce patterns in trading charts, using specific technical indicators like IBS to determine entry and exit points. The example provided shows that it has been backtested over several decades across multiple asset classes, with the most notable performance in QQQ.
