The trading strategy revolves around capitalizing on the "Santa Claus Rally" phenomenon, which historically has shown stronger performance in gold prices compared to stocks over the past two decades. Here's a concise summary of the strategy:

1. **Entry Point**: Buy gold at the close of the options expiration day in December.
2. **Exit Point**: Sell gold at the close of the first trading day of the New Year (January 1st).
3. **Performance**: The strategy has yielded an average return of over two percent per trade since the year 2000.
4. **Back Testing**: The strategy was backtested in a video, similar to other analyses conducted for their Weekly Newsletter, which can be subscribed via Quantified Strategies' website.

This approach leverages the historical tendency of gold prices to rally during this specific time frame, potentially offering traders a reliable opportunity for profit each year.
