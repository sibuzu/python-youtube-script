The trading strategy described can be summarized as follows:

1. **Entry Strategy**: 
   - Enter a long position ("buy") when the price is low or showing signs of weakness, indicating potential for an upward movement.

2. **Exit Strategy**:
   - Exit the position ("sell") using a method referred to as "Qs exit," which involves selling when the closing price exceeds the previous day's high, suggesting strong upward momentum.

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - The strategy yields an average gain of 0.59% per trade and an overall average return of 8.5%. This suggests that while each trade's profit is modest, compounded returns over multiple trades lead to significant gains.

4. **Considerations**:
   - The term "Qs exit" is unclear without additional context, potentially referring to an indicator or method.
   - The strategy may follow a trend-following approach, capitalizing on momentum until reversal.
   - Further details on signal frequency and risk management are needed for comprehensive evaluation.

In essence, the strategy aims to capitalize on upward trends by entering at lows and exiting at new highs, achieving notable returns through consistent application.
