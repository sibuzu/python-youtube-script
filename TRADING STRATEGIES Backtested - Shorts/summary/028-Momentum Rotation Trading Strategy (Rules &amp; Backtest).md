### Summary:

The article describes a momentum-based sector rotation trading system that uses monthly bars to determine asset allocation. At the end of each month, assets are ranked based on their performance over the previous 3 months, and investment is directed towards the top-performing asset for the next month. The backtest example shows substantial growth, with $100,000 growing to nearly $1.4 million in 2002.
