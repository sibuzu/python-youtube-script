The trading strategy described is a systematic approach that relies on technical analysis and automation. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Identify Predictive Indicators**: The strategy begins by identifying factors such as technical indicators (e.g., moving averages) or patterns that are believed to predict future price movements.

2. **Backtesting**: These potential predictive elements are tested using historical data through backtesting. This step ensures the strategy's validity across different market conditions and time periods.

3. **Algorithm Development**: A trading algorithm is developed based on the identified indicators. If the algorithm proves effective during testing, it is implemented; otherwise, it is discarded.

4. **Automation**: Once validated, trades are executed automatically by a computer following the algorithm's rules. This automation aims to eliminate emotional decision-making that can occur with manual trading.

5. **Example Strategy**: An example provided is using a 100-day moving average to buy when prices cross above it and sell when they drop below. The automation ensures consistent execution without human emotion.

This approach emphasizes discipline, consistency, and the removal of emotional bias through technology-driven execution.
