The seasonal short strategy involves targeting the historically worst week for the stock market, which occurs in the second half of September. The approach is straightforward: short the S&P 500 on the third Friday of September and hold the position for one week. Since 1960, this strategy has yielded an average gain of 0.9%. This method is particularly appealing because it capitalizes on a well-defined seasonal anomaly in the market, offering a rare opportunity for short trading strategies that are typically challenging to implement due to long-term stock appreciation trends.
