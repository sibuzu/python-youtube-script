---

### Trading Products

---

### Indicators  
- **MACD Histogram**: Calculated as the Fast Line minus the Slow Signal Line.

---

### Strategy Details  
- **Entry Rule**: Buy when the MACD histogram drops four days in a row from a level that was below zero four days ago.  
- **Objective**: Capitalize on mean reversion in asset prices.

---

### Backtest Performance  
- **Equity Growth**: Growing nicely upward.  
- **Annual Returns**: 5% (fails to beat the buy-and-hold strategy of the S&P 500).  
- **Drawdown**: Low drawdown of 16%.  
- **Win Rate**: Very high win rate of 89%.

---

### Conclusions  
- The strategy is considered decent due to its low investment time, which allows for complementary trading strategies.
