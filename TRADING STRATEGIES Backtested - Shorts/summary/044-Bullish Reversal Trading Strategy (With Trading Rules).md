The trading strategy described aims to capitalize on reversal patterns following significant market moves, such as breaking above or below key levels. Here's a concise summary of the strategy:

1. **Entry Criteria**:
   - The current day's low is lower than the previous day's low.
   - The current day's close is higher than the previous day's close.
   - The 5-day RSI must be below 35, indicating potential oversold conditions.

2. **Exit Strategy**:
   - Green arrows on the chart signal buy entries.
   - Red arrows indicate exit points after a specified holding period.

3. **Backtesting Results**:
   - The strategy shows higher average gains as the holding period increases.
   - Exiting trades after 24 trading days yields an average gain of 2.02% per trade, with lower volatility compared to shorter holding periods.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - Short-term exits (e.g., 1 day) result in a random walk-like equity curve, suggesting minimal edge.
   - Longer holding periods (up to 24 days) offer better returns and reduced volatility, indicating the strategy may be more effective with patient holding.

This approach combines technical indicators and reversal patterns, with backtesting suggesting improved performance over longer holding periods.
