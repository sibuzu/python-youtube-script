The trading strategy described is a well-structured approach combining two asset classes to achieve balanced growth and risk management. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Assets**: Focuses on NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) and long-term Treasury bonds (TLT). These assets have low correlation, allowing for diversification.

2. **Strategy Type**: Primarily long positions, suggesting a buy-and-hold or trend-following approach, possibly using technical indicators to manage trades.

3. **Interest Rates**: A key factor in decision-making, as growth stocks (QQQ) are sensitive to rate changes. The strategy may adjust exposure based on expected interest rate movements.

4. **Performance**: Delivered an impressive 12x return over 20 years, with drawdowns of over 20% occurring only twice. This indicates effective risk management and selective investment timing.

5. **Investment Timeframe**: Being invested only 58% of the time suggests a conservative approach, allowing for cash positions during market downturns to avoid significant losses.

6. **Risk Management**: Incorporates drawdown controls and diversification. The mention of a 55% max drawdown for buy-and-hold QQQ highlights the importance of their strategy in mitigating such risks.

7. **Considerations**: Potential risks include unexpected interest rate behavior or prolonged poor performance across asset classes. Economic cycles and inflation could also impact returns over the long term.

In conclusion, this strategy effectively balances growth potential with risk management through diversification and selective investment, demonstrating strong historical performance.
