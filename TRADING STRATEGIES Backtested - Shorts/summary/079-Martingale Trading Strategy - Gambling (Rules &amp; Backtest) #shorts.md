The Martingale trading strategy is a gambling-based approach where traders double their bet size after each loss. While it aims to recover previous losses, the strategy becomes increasingly risky and impractical, especially in trading scenarios. The strategy often leads to significant financial losses due to its exponential increase in bet sizes, which can quickly exceed manageable risk levels. As highlighted, this approach is generally deemed unsuitable for traders.
