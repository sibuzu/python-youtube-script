The trading strategy discussed revolves around ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing. Here's a concise summary:

1. **ESG Integration**: This approach involves considering ESG factors alongside traditional financial analysis when making investment decisions.

2. **Performance Overview**:
   - Since 2007, non-ESG hedge funds have outperformed ESG funds, with an annual return of 6.1% compared to 5.4% for ESG funds.
   - However, studies suggest that good ESG policies can lead to improved financial performance, potentially helping investors achieve Alpha (excess returns) and downside protection.

3. **Conclusion**: While ESG investing may not always outperform all strategies, it can offer benefits in terms of financial performance and risk management. It is crucial for investors to conduct thorough research before committing to any strategy.
