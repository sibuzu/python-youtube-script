**Summary of Out-of-Sample Backtesting Trading Strategy:**

The trading strategy involves dividing historical data into two segments for backtesting purposes. The first segment, known as the in-sample (Ensemble) period, is used to develop and refine the trading rules, parameters, and signals. The second segment, referred to as the out-of-sample period, consists of later data that was not used during the development phase.

By training the strategy on the in-sample data and then testing it on the out-of-sample data, traders can evaluate how the strategy would perform on future, unseen market conditions. This approach helps assess the strategy's potential effectiveness by providing insights into its performance without overfitting to historical data, thereby offering a more reliable forecast of future viability.

This method is crucial for traders as it allows them to gauge the robustness of their strategy before committing real capital, helping to mitigate risks associated with strategies that may perform well on historical data but fail in new market conditions.
