- **Main Points:**
  - Out-of-sample backtesting involves dividing your backtest data into two parts: the ensemble test and the out-of-sample test.
  - The ensemble test is used to create rules, signals, and parameters for the trading strategy.
  - The out-of-sample test evaluates these rules and signals on unknown, unseen data to assess their validity and effectiveness.
  - The purpose of backtesting is to forecast future performance, highlighting the importance of careful and patient testing.
  - Ensemble testing is crucial before allocating funds to a trading strategy to ensure its reliability and robustness.
