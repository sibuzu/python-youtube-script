The trading strategy in question is a momentum-based approach that switches between two asset classes: the S&P 500 (equities) and long-term treasury bonds. Here's a structured summary of the strategy:

1. **Assets Allocated**: The portfolio consists of two ETFs tracking the S&P 500 and long-term treasury bonds.

2. **Execution Frequency**: At the end of each month, the strategy assesses which asset has performed better over the past three months percentage-wise and allocates the investment to that ETF for the following month.

3. **Performance Example**: A $100,000 investment in 2003 grew to $920,000 by the present, indicating significant growth over a decade. The strategy outperformed the market by approximately 1% annually, compounded.

4. **Considerations**:
   - **Simplicity**: The strategy is straightforward, relying on two assets and monthly rebalancing, which reduces complexity and management needs.
   - **Volatility Management**: By switching between equities and bonds, the strategy aims to reduce volatility compared to holding only equities.
   - **Costs and Taxes**: Frequent trading may incur transaction costs and tax implications, which could impact returns.
   - **Market Cycles**: The strategy seems effective in different market conditions, shifting towards equities during bull markets and bonds during uncertain times.

5. **Potential Drawbacks**:
   - Reliance on recent performance (three months) might not always predict future outcomes.
   - Risk of overfitting historical data, which could affect live trading performance.

6. **Conclusion**: This strategy offers a simple yet effective approach to capitalizing on momentum between two asset classes, with demonstrated strong historical returns. However, potential investors should consider transaction costs, tax implications, and the strategy's suitability based on their risk tolerance and investment goals.
