The Russell Rebalancing Strategy is an annual trading approach that leverages the timing of the Russell 2000 Index adjustments. Traders buy the index on the first trading day after June 23rd and sell it on the following July 1st (or the next trading day if July 1st is not a market day). This strategy capitalizes on price movements caused by the index rebalancing, typically yielding a consistent 1.3% return per trade over the past two decades. The strategy's effectiveness is attributed to its annual execution and alignment with the Russell Index adjustments, ensuring both consistency and profitability each year.
