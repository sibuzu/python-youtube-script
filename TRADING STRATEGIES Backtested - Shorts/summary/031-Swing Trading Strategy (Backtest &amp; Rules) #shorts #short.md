The swing trading strategy for the S&P 500 described involves identifying a potential downtrend and using specific criteria to decide when to sell. Here's a clear breakdown of the strategy:

1. **Identify a Downtrend**: Look for two consecutive days where each day's close is lower than the previous day. This suggests a bearish trend.

2. **Evaluate on the Third Day**: On the third day (e.g., Monday), check if the closing price exceeds the high from the previous trading session.

3. **Sell Signal**: If the close on the third day is higher than the previous day's high, sell. The rationale is that this indicates a failed attempt to recover, suggesting continued downward movement.

This strategy aims to capitalize on potential downtrends by exiting positions before a possible decline. It's important to test this with historical data to assess its effectiveness and consider factors like time frames and market conditions.
