The trading strategy in question is based on the principle of mean reversion and focuses on identifying overbought and oversold conditions using a 2-day RSI (Relative Strength Index). Here's a concise summary:

1. **Entry Signal**: Buy the S&P 500 at closing when the 2-day RSI exceeds 95, indicating an overbought condition.
2. **Exit Signal**: Sell at closing when the 2-day RSI drops below 70, suggesting a potential price reversal due to mean reversion.

This strategy leverages shorter-term RSI calculations to capitalize on immediate market fluctuations. It's important to note that while this approach uses technical indicators, effective risk management is essential in trading.
