The trading strategy is based on Larry Connor's Double Seven approach, which has been modified to a Double Five strategy. Instead of using seven days as in Connor's original method, the modified version uses five days to potentially increase the number of trades. The key rules are:

1. **Buy Signal**: When the closing price is above the 200-day moving average and closes at a five-day low.
2. **Sell Signal**: When the closing price is at a five-day high.

### Strategy Features:
- **Increased Trades**: Produces more trades than Connor's original strategy, totaling 352 trades.
- **Profitability**: Generates total profits with an average gain per trade of 0.65.
- **Drawdowns**: Moderate drawdowns of up to 14%, which are short-lived.
- **Applicability**: Works across various assets including stocks, ETFs, and Futures, though instruments may exhibit correlation, leading to differing behaviors.

This strategy aims for consistent performance with manageable risk levels.
