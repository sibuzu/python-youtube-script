The trading strategy in question is a back-tested MACD strategy that incorporates Bollinger Bands on the MACD histogram. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Entry and Exit Rules**:
   - Enter a long position when the MACD histogram crosses below the lower Bollinger Band.
   - Sell (exit) when the histogram crosses above the upper Bollinger Band.

2. **Performance**:
   - Starting with $100,000, the strategy grew to $1.15 million, resulting in an annual return of 8.4%.
   - The strategy is described as having a "mixed" performance, with a solid win rate considered its main positive attribute.

3. **Drawbacks**:
   - A significant drawdown of 44% is noted, which could deter many traders from adhering to the strategy despite its overall performance being comparable to a Buy-and-Hold approach.
   - The strategy is only invested 64% of the time, meaning it frequently holds cash during periods when it is not actively trading.

In conclusion, while the strategy offers a promising return and a high win rate, the substantial drawdown and limited investment duration may pose challenges for traders considering its long-term viability.
