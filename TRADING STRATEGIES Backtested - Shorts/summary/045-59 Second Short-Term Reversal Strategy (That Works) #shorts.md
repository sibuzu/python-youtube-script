### 1. Strategy Overview: Lower Lows and Lower Highs
   - It is a mean reversion strategy published years ago.
   - Works well for many stock ETFs, including bonds.

### 2. Trading Rules and Settings:
   - Buys when both the low and high of the day are lower for three consecutive days (third day of weakness).
   - Sells two days later if the close is higher than the previous day's high.
   - Focuses on buying on weakness and selling on strength.

### 3. Trade Example:
   - Example provided with QQQ ETF.
   - Buy signal occurs on the third day of weakness.
   - Sell signal triggered when the close exceeds the previous day's high.

### 4. Backtest Performance:
   - Equity curve performance is mentioned but not as strong as the Turnaround Tuesday strategy.
   - A $100,000 portfolio compounds to nearly $600,000 annually at almost an 8% return.

### 5. Drawdown and Risk Considerations:
   - Experienced a significant drawdown of 31% during the bear market from 2000 to 2003.
   - Performance has been strong since then.

### 6. Applicability Beyond QQQ:
   - Strategy works well on other stock ETFs, including bonds.

### 7. Conclusions:
   - While the equity curve is not superior to alternative strategies like Turnaround Tuesday, it shows consistent performance over time.
   - Drawdown during the 2000-2003 bear market is a notable risk factor.
   - Suitable for investors looking for a mean reversion approach in ETFs.
