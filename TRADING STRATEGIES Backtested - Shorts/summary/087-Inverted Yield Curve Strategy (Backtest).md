**Summary of Trading Strategy Using Yield Curves**

A trading strategy based on the yield curve involves understanding two key concepts: normal and inverted yield curves. A **normal yield curve** exists when longer maturity bonds offer higher yields than shorter ones, reflecting the increased risk associated with holding investments over a longer period. Conversely, an **inverted yield curve** occurs when shorter-term bonds have higher yields than longer-term ones, which can signal potential economic changes.

The strategy employs two approaches:

1. **Inversion-Triggered Strategy**: This involves buying assets when the yield curve inverts and selling 250 days later. Since 1976, this approach has yielded an average return of 7.3% with a maximum drawdown of 18%, outperforming the S&P 500's 4.3% return over the same period.

2. **Slope-Based Strategy**: This strategy uses the slope of the yield curve to guide investments. A positive slope (normal curve) prompts going long, while a negative slope (inverted curve) leads to short positions. This approach has delivered an average return of 8.3% with a maximum drawdown of 20%.

Both strategies have outperformed the S&P 500, yet they are not without risks, as evidenced by their significant drawdowns. The conclusion emphasizes that while inverted yield curves can be useful indicators, they should be part of a broader investment strategy due to potential conflicts with other indicators and the unpredictability in volatile markets. Thus, reliance on such indicators should be balanced with other factors for more reliable predictions.
