The trading strategy described is a **positional trading approach** that involves holding positions for an extended period, typically weeks to several months. It is considered a long-term strategy but differs from the traditional "Buy and Hold" method by incorporating periodic rotations based on performance.

### Key Features of the Strategy:
1. **Assets Involved**: The strategy focuses on four ETFs:  
   - SPY (S&P 500)  
   - EFA (MSCI Europe ex-US)  
   - EEM (iShares MSCI Emerging Markets)  
   - TLT (20-Year Treasury Bond ETF)

2. **Trading Rules**:  
   - At the end of each month, the four ETFs are ranked based on their performance.  
   - The ETF with the best performance is selected and held for one month.  
   - This process is repeated monthly.

3. **Performance**:  
   - The strategy generated an average monthly gain of **1.3%**.  
   - Annualized returns were **10.1%**.  
   - However, it faced significant challenges in 2022, with a loss of **40%**, highlighting its vulnerability during market downturns.

4. **Equity Curve**: The equity curve reflects the cumulative performance of the strategy over time, showing periods of growth and drawdowns, particularly in 2022.

### Conclusion:
This strategy combines elements of long-term investing with periodic adjustments based on asset performance. While it has shown promising returns historically, its reliance on monthly rotations makes it sensitive to short-term market fluctuations, as evidenced by the significant loss in 2022.
