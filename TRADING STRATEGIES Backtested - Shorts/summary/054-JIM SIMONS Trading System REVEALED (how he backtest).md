The trading strategy involves identifying indicators that predict future price movements. These indicators are tested rigorously using historical data to determine their effectiveness. If an indicator works, it is incorporated into a systematic trading approach; if not, it is discarded. This method ensures that only reliable and predictive elements are used in the trading system.
