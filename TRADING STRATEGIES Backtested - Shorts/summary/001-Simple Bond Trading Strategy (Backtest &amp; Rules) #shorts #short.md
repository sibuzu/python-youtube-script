The trading strategy described is designed to exploit seasonal patterns in the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT). Here's a structured summary:

1. **Strategy Overview**:
   - The strategy involves buying TLT on the seventh last trading day of each month and then selling short by the end of the month.
   - The short position is closed on the seventh trading day of the following month.

2. **Mechanics**:
   - **Entry Point**: Purchase TLT around mid-month (seventh last trading day).
   - **Exit Points**: Sell short at month-end and cover the short on the seventh day of the new month.

3. **Performance**:
   - The strategy claims to grow $100,000 to $735,000 over 20 years, indicating a significant return. This suggests an average annualized return around 8-9%, though compounded growth plays a role.

4. **Rationale Behind the Strategy**:
   - Potential seasonal factors include tax selling, institutional positioning, or economic event-driven market movements.
   - The strategy may capitalize on TLT's price behavior related to interest rates and inflation expectations.

5. **Considerations and Risks**:
   - **Transaction Costs**: High-frequency trading could incur significant fees.
   - **Market Changes**: Seasonal patterns may lose effectiveness over time as market conditions evolve.
   - **Leverage**: While not explicitly mentioned, leveraged positions could amplify returns but also risks.

6. **Systematic vs. Discretionary**:
   - The strategy appears systematic, potentially automatable with strict rules, though its robustness depends on the consistency of underlying patterns.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - While the strategy has delivered strong historical returns by exploiting seasonal patterns, it requires careful consideration of economic conditions, transaction costs, and the sustainability of these patterns over time.

This approach leverages systematic trading rules based on observed market patterns in TLT, aiming to capitalize on recurring price movements while managing associated risks.
