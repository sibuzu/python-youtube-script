The trading strategy in question involves a monthly end-of-month approach with the Russell 2000 index, focusing on short holding periods. Here's a structured summary of the strategy and its performance:

1. **Strategy Overview:**
   - **Entry Point:** Buy on the last fifth trading day of each month.

   - **Post-2010 Performance:** While still positive, returns have weakened compared to previous decades.

4. **Considerations:**
   - Transaction costs and slippage could impact returns, though they haven't significantly eroded performance until recently.
   - Russell 2000's small-cap nature may contribute to its volatility and sensitivity to economic conditions.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The strategy efficiently captures market gains during short holding periods each month, demonstrating resilience over decades with a notable shift in performance post-2010. It offers a balance between active management and reduced market exposure.
