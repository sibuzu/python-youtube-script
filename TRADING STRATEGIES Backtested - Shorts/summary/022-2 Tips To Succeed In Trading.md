The trading strategy emphasizes the importance of having a **positive statistical expectancy** as the foundation for success, rather than solely focusing on mindset and risk management, though these are still considered crucial. The key points are:

1. **Positive Statistical Expectancy**: This is the most critical factor in making money trading or investing. It refers to the likelihood that a strategy will generate profits over time.

2. **Having an Edge**: Most traders lack a true edge, which makes it difficult to consistently profit regardless of their mindset or risk management skills.

3. **Strategy Development**: To succeed, one must:
   - Quantify and backtest strategies to ensure they have a positive expectancy.
   - Develop the discipline to follow the strategy consistently.

The strategy encourages aspiring traders to start by identifying and testing potential strategies that align with their personality and goals.
