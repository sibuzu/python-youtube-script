The NR7 trading strategy, developed by Tony Krabelle in 1990, is a volatility-based approach designed to capitalize on low volatility periods followed by trend movements. Here's a structured summary of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
- **Objective**: To enter the market during low volatility and exit when a strong upward movement occurs.

### Key Components:
1. **Volatility Measurement**:
   - Volatility is defined as the difference between the daily High and Low prices.
   - The strategy identifies entry points when today's range (High-Low) is the smallest among the previous six trading days.

2. **Entry Signal**:
   - Enter a long position at the close of the day if today's range is the lowest in the last six days.

3. **Exit Signal**:
   - Exit the trade when the current day's closing price exceeds the previous day's high, then close the position at the end of that day.

### Backtesting Results:
- Tested from 1993 to present with a starting capital of $100,000.
- Achieved an upward equity curve with an 8% annualized growth rate.

### Considerations and Implications:
- **Market Conditions**: The strategy may perform differently during high volatility periods or in various asset classes (stocks, forex, commodities).
- **Risk Management**: Potential risks include transaction costs, slippage, and the fact that past performance does not guarantee future results.
- **Psychological Aspects**: Requires discipline to adhere to entry/exit rules despite market fluctuations.
- **Automation**: The strategy can potentially be automated for efficient execution.

### Conclusion:
NR7 is a simple yet effective trend-following strategy that leverages low volatility periods. While backtesting shows promising results, traders should consider additional testing across different markets and conditions, and be mindful of associated risks and costs.
