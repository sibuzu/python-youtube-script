The trading strategy described is a momentum rotation approach involving three ETFs: SPY (S&P 500), GLD (Gold), and TLT (Bonds). Developed by Meb Faber around 2015, the strategy uses monthly bars to generate signals. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Signals**: 
   - Invest or stay long when the 3-month Simple Moving Average (SMA) is above the 10-month SMA.
   
2. **Allocation**:
   - Allocate one-third of capital to each ETF when a signal is received.
   - If signals occur in two ETFs, invest 66% of equity, keeping 33% in cash.

3. **Performance**:
   - The strategy performed well until 2015 with an annual return of nearly 8% and a modest maximum drawdown of 18%.
   - Since 2015, the annual return has dropped to just under 3%.

4. **Current Market Context**:
   - Currently, all three moving averages are above their respective counterparts, indicating an uptrend.
   - Recent market corrections have raised questions about whether the strategy will rebound or if adjustments are needed.

In summary, this is a momentum-based approach that shifts capital between stocks, bonds, and gold based on moving average crossovers. While historically effective, its performance has waned since 2015, prompting consideration of potential adjustments in light of recent market dynamics.
