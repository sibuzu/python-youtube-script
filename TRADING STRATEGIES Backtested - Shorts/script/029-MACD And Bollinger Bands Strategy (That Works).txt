[00:00] back-tested macd strategy which uses a
[00:03] Bollinger band of the macd histogram we
[00:06] enter a long position when the histogram
[00:08] crosses below the lower Bollinger band
[00:10] and we sell when the histogram crosses
[00:13] above the upper band The 100 000
[00:15] invested grows to 1.15 million today
[00:18] which equals an annual return of 8.4
[00:22] percent the strategy's performance is
[00:24] mixed the positive takeaway is a solid
[00:27] win rate because we believe the win rate
[00:29] is crucial for most traders to stick to
[00:32] a strategy however the negative is the
[00:35] huge drawdown of 44 with such a drawdown
[00:38] We Believe most Traders would abandon
[00:40] the strategy even though the strategy
[00:42] performs almost as well as Buy and Hold
[00:45] despite being invested just 64 of the
[00:48] time
