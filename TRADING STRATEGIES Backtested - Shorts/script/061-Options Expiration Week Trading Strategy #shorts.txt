[00:00] today we're talking about the options
[00:02] expiration week effect often abbreviated
[00:04] Opex week once a month us options expire
[00:07] on the third Friday of the month because
[00:09] options have a finite life they stop
[00:11] trading at certain dates the trading
[00:13] rules are simple we buy the Monday open
[00:16] of the Opex week and we sell at the
[00:18] close of the Opex day the result is not
[00:20] a straight line but it's sloping upwards
