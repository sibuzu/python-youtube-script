[00:00] our frequency trading is a method or
[00:02] trading that uses powerful computer
[00:04] programs to make a large number of
[00:06] Trades often in fractions of a second
[00:08] it's a type of algorithmic trading
[00:11] strategy that uses high speeds and high
[00:13] turnover to take advantage of small
[00:15] short-lived profitable opportunities in
[00:18] the markets it's a strategy that only
[00:21] has room for a limited number of players
[00:23] high frequency trading is capital
[00:26] intensive and requires technical skills
[00:29] even after getting the software one
[00:31] needs VPS services that can host the
[00:35] system right next to the exchange to
[00:37] reduce latency and increase the chances
[00:39] of success hence this is not a game for
[00:43] a retail Trader
[00:44] instead of high frequency trading we
[00:47] believe it's a better idea to use slow
[00:49] frequency trading we have published
[00:52] hundreds of such strategies at
[00:54] quantifiedstrategies.com
