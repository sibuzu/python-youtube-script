[00:00] percent B is an indicator that measure
[00:02] where the close is relative to the upper
[00:04] and lower Bollinger Bands as indicated
[00:07] on the chart we use a five-day lookback
[00:09] period and two standard deviations for
[00:12] the Bollinger Bands when the close is in
[00:14] the lower range of the indicator it
[00:16] signals a buying opportunity opposite it
[00:19] signals a potential good exit when it's
[00:22] in the high end of the range the
[00:24] calculation of percent B is shown on the
[00:26] screen and it resembles the IBS
[00:28] indicator an indicator we have covered
[00:30] in a separate video and is perhaps the
[00:33] most useful indicator for stocks the
[00:35] rules for buying is when the percent B
[00:38] is lower than 0.2 for the third
[00:40] consecutive day and the close is above
[00:43] the 200-day moving average we sell when
[00:46] the close is higher than yesterday's
[00:47] high the equity indicates it's not many
[00:50] trades only 55 and the win rate is 87
[00:53] which is very respectable considering
[00:56] that the average winners and losers are
[00:58] about the same size
