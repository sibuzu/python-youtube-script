[00:00] Larry Connors multiple days up and
[00:02] multiple days down strategy we buy when
[00:05] the close is above the 200-day moving
[00:07] average the close must be below the
[00:09] five-day moving average and must have
[00:11] dropped at least four days out of the
[00:12] last five trading days we sell when the
[00:15] close is higher than yesterday's high
[00:17] the equity curve for S P 500 is sloping
[00:21] upwards with an average gain per trade
[00:23] of 0.55 percent and an annual return of
[00:27] four percent the latter is not that high
[00:30] but the strategy is invested only 10
[00:32] percent of the time again because we use
[00:35] the 200-day moving average to filter a
[00:37] bullish environment the max drawdown is
[00:40] only 13 percent
