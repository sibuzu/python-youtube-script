[00:00] should you buy or sell when you hear the
[00:01] sound of cannons on the screen you'll
[00:03] see how the S&P 500 is performed after
[00:06] major conflicts however we suspect the
[00:08] main reason is that Wars are often
[00:10] anticipated and priced in by the markets
[00:12] before they start for example on the
[00:14] screen you see that US Stocks already
[00:16] had fallen prior to the attack on Pearl
[00:18] Harbor and just a few weeks later the
[00:20] stock market rallied and it didn't look
[00:22] bad it might be wise to follow the
[00:24] famous advice of Nathan Rothschild buy
[00:27] to the sound of cannons sell to the
[00:29] sound of trumpets
