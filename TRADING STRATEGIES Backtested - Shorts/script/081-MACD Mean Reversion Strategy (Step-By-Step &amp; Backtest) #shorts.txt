[00:00] this strategy is based on the macd
[00:02] histogram the macd histogram is the fast
[00:05] line subtracted from the slower signal
[00:07] Line This is a mean reversion strategy
[00:10] and the trading rules are on the screen
[00:11] we do this by buying when the macd
[00:14] histogram drops four days in a row from
[00:17] a level that was below zero four days
[00:19] ago the equity is growing nicely upward
[00:21] but the annual returns of five percent
[00:23] fail to beat the buy and hold of the S P
[00:26] 500 but that is explained by the load
[00:29] time spent in the market only five
[00:31] percent
[00:32] considering this we believe the strategy
[00:35] is decent because the low investment
[00:37] time frees up time to trade other
[00:39] complementary strategies the positive is
[00:42] that the strategy has a very high win
[00:44] rate of 89 percent and a low drawdown of
[00:47] 16 percent
