[00:00] Larry Connor's double seven trading
[00:02] strategy however we rephrase it to
[00:04] double five trading strategy Connors
[00:07] originally used seven trading days in
[00:09] the settings but we only use five days
[00:11] to get more trades when the close is
[00:13] above the 200-day moving average and
[00:16] closes at a five-day low we buy we sell
[00:19] when the close is at a five-day High the
[00:21] rules are simple and the produce the
[00:23] following Equity curve as shown on the
[00:25] screen our modified strategy produces
[00:27] more trades than Connor's original
[00:29] strategy 352 in total and thus more
[00:32] total profits the average gain per trade
[00:35] is 0.65 and the drawdowns are moderate
[00:38] at Max 14 and they are short-lived we'd
[00:41] like to mention that the strategy works
[00:43] on a wide range of stock ETFs and
[00:45] Futures but they tend to be correlated
