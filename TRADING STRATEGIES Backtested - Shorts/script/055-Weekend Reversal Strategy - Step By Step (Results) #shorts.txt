[00:00] let's jump straight to our first
[00:01] strategy of this video the turnaround
[00:03] Tuesday strategy
[00:05] this strategy has worked in the stock
[00:07] market for many decades and has been
[00:09] low-hanging fruit for many years we
[00:11] wrote about this strategy on our website
[00:13] as long back as 2012. so what's this ETF
[00:16] strategy all about we buy S P 500 at the
[00:19] close on a Monday if the close is lower
[00:22] than on Friday or the last trading day a
[00:24] Friday was a non-trading day
[00:26] we sell on a day when the close ends
[00:28] higher than yesterday's high or after
[00:30] five trading days a trade example is
[00:33] shown on the screen the Green Arrow
[00:35] shows a Monday where spy the ETF that
[00:38] tracks S P 500 opens up but Falls
[00:40] throughout the day and ends lower than
[00:42] Friday
[00:43] we buy and sell two days later when spy
[00:46] rallies and closes above the yesterday's
[00:48] high
[00:49] the equity curve shows that 100
[00:52] 000 invested in spy in 1993 is worth
[00:55] almost 2.2 million today if we only
[00:58] trade this ETF strategy
