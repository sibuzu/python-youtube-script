[00:01] out of sample back testing is when you
[00:04] divide your back test into two parts in
[00:06] Ensemble versus out of sample for
[00:08] example if you have data from 2005 until
[00:12] 2022 then base your insult back test on
[00:16] data from 2005 until 2018 and the auto
[00:20] sample from 2018 until 2022.
[00:24] The Ensemble test is where you make the
[00:26] rules the signals and the parameters the
[00:29] auto sample is where you test your rules
[00:31] and signals on unknown data the whole
[00:34] point of doing back tests is to forecast
[00:36] the future doing so you need to be
[00:39] careful and patient we believe in our
[00:41] Ensemble test is an important aspect of
[00:43] this procedure before you allocate money
[00:46] to a strategy
