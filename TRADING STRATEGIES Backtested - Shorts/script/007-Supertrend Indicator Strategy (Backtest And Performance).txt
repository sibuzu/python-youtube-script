[00:00] the super Trend indicator calculates a
[00:01] median price of a candle and adds bands
[00:04] above and below the median price the
[00:06] bands use a 10we lookback period and
[00:08] three times the average true range buy
[00:11] when the close of a bar crosses above
[00:13] the previous value of the super Trend
[00:15] indicator sell when the close of a bar
[00:17] crosses below the previous value of the
[00:19] super Trend indicator the example on the
[00:21] screen shows a trade example of 44% but
[00:24] of course not all trades turn out so
[00:26] well when we back test on S&P 500 the 38
[00:30] trades made annual gains of almost 6%
