[00:00] can the stock market's performance in
[00:01] January indicate the performance the
[00:03] rest of the year let's define the
[00:05] trading rule if the close of January is
[00:08] higher than the close of December we buy
[00:10] S&P 500 and stay invested until the end
[00:13] of the year which is 11 months the
[00:14] average gain is 10.5% not considering
[00:17] dividends and this is substantially
[00:19] better than any random 11-month period
[00:21] the reason for the good performance is
[00:23] that losing years only drop 8% on
[00:26] average while the winning years rise
[00:28] almost 15% if the Jan anuary barometer
[00:30] shows a negative signal the performance
[00:32] the rest of the year is clearly not good
