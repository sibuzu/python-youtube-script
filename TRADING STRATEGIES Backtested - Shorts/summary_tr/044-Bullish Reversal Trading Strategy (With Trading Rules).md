所描述的交易策略旨在利用重大市场转移后的逆转模式，例如在关键水平上方或低于关键水平以下。 这是该战略的简明摘要：

1. **进入标准** ：
   - The current day's low is lower than the previous day's low.
   - The current day's close is higher than the previous day's close.
   - The 5-day RSI must be below 35, indicating potential oversold conditions.

2. **退出策略** ：
   - Green arrows on the chart signal buy entries.
   - Red arrows indicate exit points after a specified holding period.

3. **进行回测结果** ：
   - The strategy shows higher average gains as the holding period increases.
   - Exiting trades after 24 trading days yields an average gain of 2.02% per trade, with lower volatility compared to shorter holding periods.

4. **关键观察** ：
   - Short-term exits (e.g., 1 day) result in a random walk-like equity curve, suggesting minimal edge.
   - Longer holding periods (up to 24 days) offer better returns and reduced volatility, indicating the strategy may be more effective with patient holding.

这种方法将技术指标和逆转模式结合在一起，进行回测的表明，在较长的持有期间的性能提高了。
