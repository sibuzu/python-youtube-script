三重RSI交易策略以其对相对强度指数（RSI）的依赖而得名，旨在利用股票市场长期上升趋势的回调。 这是该战略的简明摘要：

1. **进入条件** ：
   - The 5-day RSI must be below 30.
   - The RSI must have declined for three consecutive days.
   - The RSI reading three days prior was below 60.

2. **表现** ：
   - Since its implementation from 1993 to the present, it has generated only 83 trades.
   - It boasts an impressive win rate of 90%, with the average gain per trade being nearly 1.4%.

该策略旨在利用上升趋势中的市场回调，利用RSI指标在原本不断上升的趋势中确定潜在的购买机会。
