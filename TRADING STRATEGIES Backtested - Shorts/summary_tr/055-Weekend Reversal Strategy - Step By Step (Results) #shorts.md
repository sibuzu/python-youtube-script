所描述的交易策略称为 "Turnaround Tuesday" 战略，几十年来一直在股市有效。 这是该策略的摘要：

1. **进入信号** ：
   - On a Monday, if the closing price of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is lower than its price on the previous Friday, it triggers the entry signal.
   - This assumes that Friday was the last trading day before Monday.

2. **购买点** ：
   - Investors buy SPY at the close of trading on such a Monday.

3. **退出信号** ：
   - The exit occurs either on Tuesday if SPY closes higher than its previous day's (Monday's) high, or after five trading days, whichever comes first.
   -这意味着持有期是一天（星期二退出）或最多五天。

4. **理由** ：
   - The strategy aims to capitalize on short-term price movements following a downclose on Monday, with the expectation that SPY will rally by Tuesday or within five days.
   - It suggests that this approach has historically been profitable, as demonstrated by the example where $100,000 invested in SPY using this strategy grew to nearly $2.2 million over time.

该策略似乎是一种短期交易方法，可能利用市场动力和均值逆转原则。 但是，重要的是要注意，过去的绩效并不能指示未来的结果，并且应在个人风险承受能力和市场状况方面仔细考虑任何投资策略。
