[00:00] nr7 was first developed by Tony krabble
[00:02] back in 1990 and is a volatility
[00:04] strategy the main idea of nr7 is to
[00:06] enter the market when it's in a low
[00:08] volatility period ride the trend until
[00:11] the market shows signs of strength and
[00:13] then exit the range or volatility is
[00:15] defined as the difference between the
[00:17] daily High and the low if today has the
[00:19] lowest range of the previous last six
[00:21] trading days then we go long at the
[00:23] close the exit is at the close when
[00:25] today's close is higher than yesterday's
[00:27] high when we back test this strategy
[00:29] from 1993 until today we start with
[00:32] 100,000 USD and end up with an equity
[00:34] curve that shows an upward slope
