[00:02] short-term rates are higher than
[00:03] long-term rates this doesn't happen

[00:07] followed by an economic recession
[00:09] but is an inverted yield curve a Buy
[00:12] Signal for stocks we did two back tests

[00:17] buy S P 500 and hold it for 250 days
[00:20] since 1976 we've had 11 trades and the
[00:24] average gain is 7.35 percent which is
[00:27] more or less the same return as Buy and
[00:29] Hold
[00:29] if you hold for 500 Days the return
[00:32] increases to 18.3 percent which is
[00:34] slightly better than Buy and Hold our
[00:37] second back test is using a five-day RSI
[00:40] on the yield curve and buy stocks when
[00:43] it gets oversold and hit 20 and we sell
[00:46] when it is overbought and hit 80. the
