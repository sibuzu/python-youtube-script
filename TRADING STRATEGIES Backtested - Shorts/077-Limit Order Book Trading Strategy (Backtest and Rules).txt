[00:00] limit order book trading strategy
[00:04] the limit order book strategy is based
[00:06] on the order flow the order flow is an
[00:08] electronic record maintained by an
[00:10] exchange of all buy and sell limit
[00:11] orders that come in for a given
[00:13] instrument this is an example of a limit
[00:15] order book on the bid side which is buy
[00:18] limit orders prices are arranged from
[00:20] highest to lowest and according to the
[00:22] time the orders came in on the ask side
[00:24] which is sell limit orders prices are
[00:26] ranked from lowest to highest and
[00:28] according to the time the orders came in
[00:30] you can record straight on this
[00:31] information but we believe you are
[00:33] unlikely to be successful in the long
[00:35] run it's difficult and such a strategy
[00:37] is even more difficult to backtest as a
[00:40] retail Trader we believe the best option
[00:42] is to focus on Quantified strategies
[00:43] that are back tested we have over the
[00:45] last 10 years provided hundreds of such
[00:47] strategies completely free of charge
