[00:00] our opinion is that too many Traders
[00:02] Focus too much on mindset and risk
[00:05] management by all means they are
[00:07] important but they are not as important
[00:09] as having a positive statistical
[00:11] expectancy
[00:13] we suspect that most Traders don't have
[00:15] any Edge in the first place and thus
[00:17] it's very difficult to make any money
[00:19] regardless of mindset and risk
[00:21] management
[00:23] to make money at trading or investing
[00:25] you need to make sure you have at least
[00:26] two things sorted one a positive
[00:29] statistical expectancy and two the
[00:32] ability to follow the strategy that
[00:35] should be the starting point for any
[00:37] aspiring Trader do yourself a favor and
[00:40] start quantifying and back testing your
[00:42] strategies

[00:46] trading strategy please visit
