[00:00] the strategy is called Lower lows and
[00:02] lower highs and was published years ago
[00:04] it's a mean reversion strategy and works
[00:07] for many stock ETFs
[00:09] the trading rules and settings are
[00:11] pretty straightforward and we buy when
[00:13] both the low and high of the day is
[00:15] lower for the third day in a row
[00:17] we buy on weakness and sell on strength
[00:20] a trade example in QQQ is shown on the
[00:23] screen where we buy on the third day of
[00:25] weakness and we sell two days later on
[00:27] an update when the close is higher than
[00:29] yesterday's high
[00:31] the equity curve is not as good as the
[00:33] turnaround Tuesday strategy but still
[00:35] the 100 000 compounds at almost eight
[00:38] percent annually and ends up above 600
[00:40] 000.
[00:41] the average gain per trade is almost one
[00:44] percent but the strategy suffers a
[00:46] drawdown of 31 during the bear Market of
[00:49] 2000 to 2003 but since then it's
[00:52] performed really well this ETF trading
[00:55] strategy Works nicely on other stock
[00:57] ETFs as well even bonds
