[00:00] did you know that the stock market has
[00:02] seasonal patterns the stock market tends
[00:04] to follow certain trends at different
[00:06] times of the year and if you know how to
[00:08] identify these patterns you can use them
[00:10] to your advantage and perhaps make money
[00:12] on it in today's video we're going to
[00:15] show you five seasonal trading
[00:17] strategies in which you see the back
[00:19] tested results on the screen so stick
[00:22] around until the end to get the trading
[00:24] rules and please don't forget to
[00:26] subscribe or like for more seasonal
[00:28] trading strategies
[00:31] let's go to the first seasonal trading
[00:33] strategy which is the Santa Claus
[00:35] rally Santa comes early to the stock
[00:38] market and we buy S&P 500 on the first
[00:41] Friday after calendar day 14 in December
[00:45] we sell on the third trading day of the
[00:47] New
[00:48] Year the seasonal effect has been pretty
[00:51] consistent with almost linear growth
[00:53] since
[00:54] 1960 the average gain is
[00:57] 1.34% and you're invested only 4% of the
[00:59] the time let's look at the trading rules
[01:02] of the second seasonal trading strategy
[01:05] which is for the Russell 2000 Index the
[01:08] strategy takes advantage of the annual
[01:10] rebalancing of Russell 2000 in late June
[01:13] and we buy the index on the first
[01:15] trading day after June 23rd and sell on
[01:19] the first trading day of
[01:21] July again we see a steady growth and a
[01:24] high win rate since
[01:26] 1987 the trading statistics are good
[01:29] with 1 3% average gain and we can also
[01:32] add that the strategy works well for S&P
[01:34] 500 but not as good as for Russell
[01:38] 200000 we continue with our seasonal
[01:40] trading strategies and reveal the third
[01:42] one which is the Easter holiday this
[01:45] strategy buys S&P 500 at the close on
[01:48] the Wednesday before Good Friday and
[01:50] sells at the close on Holy Thursday the
[01:52] day before Good Friday you're invested
[01:55] for only 24 hours again the performance
[01:58] is pretty solid with with consistent
[02:00] gains since
[02:02] 1960 you've made an average of 35% in 24
[02:06] hours this is 8 times better than any
[02:09] random day we don't stop here and our
[02:12] fourth seasonal trading strategy is a
[02:14] pretty similar one for the Thanksgiving
[02:16] holiday before Thanksgiving we buy S&P
[02:18] 500 on Tuesday and we sell 24 hours
[02:22] later on Wednesday the day before
[02:24] Thanksgiving the equity curve is rising
[02:26] steadily since 1960 but there have been
[02:29] a few rough Fe along the way the average
[02:32] gain is 3% and worth noting is that we
[02:35] witnessed a 22-year streak of winning
[02:38] trades the fifth and last of our
[02:40] seasonal trading strategies is also for
[02:42] S&P 500 and is called the turn of the
[02:45] month strategy this strategy exploits
[02:48] the strong bias at the end of the month
[02:50] and the first few days of the new month
[02:53] to be more precise we buy five trading
[02:55] days before month's end and we exit
[02:58] three trading days into the new month
[03:00] month our back test doesn't include
[03:02] dividends but this simple seasonal
[03:04] trading strategy has beaten by and hold
[03:06] since 1960 despite being invested only
[03:09] 33% of the time the average gain per
[03:13] trade is 6 and the draw Downs are more
[03:15] than half compared to buy and hold if we
[03:18] turn the strategy upside down and are
[03:20] only invested when it's not turn of the-
[03:22] month days you can see the terrible
[03:25] performance you would have lost money
[03:28] we've now back tested five seasonal
[03:30] trading strategies that are easy to
[03:31] implement but remember this is not
[03:33] investment advice there exist many more
[03:37] seasonalities and they're all covered on
[03:38] our website not only for stocks but also
[03:41] for bonds and other
[03:44] assets
