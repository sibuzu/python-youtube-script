[00:01] as the year winds down you may have
[00:03] heard about the end ofe stock market
[00:05] rally is this seasonality fact or
[00:07] fiction the end of year stock market
[00:10] rally is no myth research and back test
[00:12] show that stock prices tend to rise
[00:14] toward the end of the year let's look at
[00:17] the history for S&P 500 and we make two
[00:20] back tests first we back test the
[00:22] performance from the third Friday in
[00:24] December until the last day of the year
[00:27] the capital compounds pretty
[00:28] consistently since 19 1970 and in 68% of
[00:32] the years you make a profit overall the
[00:35] average end ofe stock market rally is
[00:37] made a 1% gain and the typical winner is
[00:40] substantially higher than the average
[00:42] loser a 1% gain for being invested about
[00:45] 8 trading days is pretty good if you ask
[00:48] us let's make a second back test where
[00:50] you go long at the close of the fifth
[00:52] last trading day of the year and you
[00:54] sell at the closing print of the Year
[00:58] this is not performed as well as the
[00:59] first test but clearly there's a
[01:01] consistent upward drift since
[01:04] 1970 and the average winner is about
[01:06] twice as large as the average loser
[01:09] overall history shows that the stock
[01:11] market tends to go up at the end of the
[01:13] year and thus there's an endof year
[01:15] stock market rally if you like this
