[00:01] while New Year's Eve is often associated
[00:03] with optimism and celebration does this
[00:06] translate to positive stock market
[00:08] performance is there a New Year's Eve
[00:11] effect in the stock market first let's
[00:13] look at the performance of the last
[00:15] trading day of the year we buy S&P 500
[00:18] at the close of the second last trading
[00:20] day of the year and we sell one day
[00:22] later at the last print of the year the
[00:26] chart shows that since 1970 the
[00:28] performance has been pretty erratic
[00:30] there is no New Year's Eve effect in the
[00:32] stock market let's change the trading
[00:35] rules we buy on the second last trading
[00:38] day of the year and we sell after end
[00:40] days the first Days of the New Year are
[00:43] positive if we hold for four days and
[00:45] sell on the third trading day of the new
[00:47] year we get a positive return but not as
[00:50] consistent as we had hoped celebrations
[00:53] aside there's no clear-cut New Year's
[00:55] Eve effect on stocks nonetheless
[00:58] optimism tends to persist into the New
[01:01] Year if you like this video please
