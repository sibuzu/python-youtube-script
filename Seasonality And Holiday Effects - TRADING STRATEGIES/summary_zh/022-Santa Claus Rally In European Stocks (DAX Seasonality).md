#### 2. **Trading Assets**
- **US Stocks**: The traditional Santa Claus Rally is discussed.
- **German DAX Index**: Represented by the ETF *EWG* (a liquid and long-traded proxy for the DAX index).
- **European STOXX 50 Index**: Represented by the ETF *FEZ* (tracks blue-chip stocks from 11 Eurozone countries).

---

#### 3. **Trading Strategy**
- **Entry Signal**: 
  - Enter a long position a few days before Christmas.
  - Specifically, on the third Friday of December when DAX Futures expire.
- **Exit Signal**:
  - Sell on the last trading day of the year.
- **Position Holding Period**:
  - Typically ranges from 6 to 10 days.
  - If entered earlier (one week before Christmas), holding period increases, but so do returns and volatility.

#### 4. **Backtesting Performance**
- **DAX Proxy (*EWG*)**:
  - Since inception (not specified year), win rate: **81%**.
  - Average gain per trade: **2.1%**.
  - Over the last decade, gains have diminished slightly.
- **European STOXX 50 Proxy (*FEZ*)**:
  - Since inception in 2002, win rate: **81%**.
  - Average gain per trade: **1.5%**.

#### 5. **Conclusion**
The analysis confirms the presence of a Santa Claus Rally in European stocks (both DAX and STOXX 50). However:
- The average gains have been diminishing over time, particularly for DAX.
- Early entry into the position increases holding period and returns but also introduces greater volatility.

This strategy appears to be viable but may require continuous monitoring to adapt to changing market dynamics.
