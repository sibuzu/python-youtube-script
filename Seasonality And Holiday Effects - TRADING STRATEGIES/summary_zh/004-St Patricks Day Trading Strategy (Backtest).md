 **最终答案：** 

称为圣帕特里克节效应的贸易策略认为，股票可能会在3月17日左右表现良好，这可能是由于格林颜色的积极含义所致。 该方法涉及在圣帕特里克节（St. Patrick's Day）前的最后一笔交易日，在假期或接下来的交易日出售，投资范围为一个交易日。

 **要点：** 

1. **策略概述** ：
   - Enter by purchasing on the last trading day before March 17th.
   - Exit by selling on March 17th or the subsequent trading day.

2. **历史表现** ：
   - Since 1960, average gain is 21% with mixed results.
   - From 1993 onwards, average gain jumps to 53% with a 67% win rate.

3. **警告和注意事项** ：
   - High daily gains (e.g., 53%) are unusually significant for a single trading day without major news.
   - Sample size may be too small, potentially leading to results influenced by chance.
   - Transaction costs could diminish returns over time.
   - Survivorship bias might skew the data presented.
   - No clear market fundamentals link St. Patrick's Day to stock performance; strategy appears more marketing-driven.

 **结论** ：在吸引人的同时，该策略缺乏一致的可靠性证据，并且不建议进行认真投资。 最好专注于具有经过验证的长期一致性的策略。
