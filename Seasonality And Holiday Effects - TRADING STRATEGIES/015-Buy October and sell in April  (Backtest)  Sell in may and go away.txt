[00:00] um the Market's been pretty rough lately
[00:02] and uh and uh it's October now what do
[00:06] you think about the market is it the
[00:08] time to invest soon
[00:10] well I I don't like to think so I like
[00:13] to use statistics so I made a made a
[00:17] back test here on the SPX which is S P
[00:20] 500 and this is you buy first of October
[00:24] and you sell at the end of April and as
[00:26] you can see it has worked pretty pretty
[00:29] well from 1960 until today
[00:33] uh if I am not mistaken I think this is
[00:37] a pretty famous uh seasonal tendency
[00:40] isn't it what is it called
[00:42] uh I think it's a result of the cell in
[00:45] May and go away because uh the returns
[00:49] from the end of April until first of
[00:52] October is basically zero for for for 60
[00:56] years
