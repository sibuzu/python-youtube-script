[00:00] how have stocks performed during the
[00:02] Thanksgiving holiday pretty good
[00:04] actually if you stick to the end we'll
[00:06] show you three Thanksgiving seasonal
[00:08] trading strategies that have performed
[00:10] well since
[00:12] 1960 let's go straight to the first one
[00:14] we buy S&P 500 on Tuesday before
[00:17] Thanksgiving and we sell 24 hours later
[00:20] the day before
[00:21] Thanksgiving since 1960 this has been a
[00:24] pretty consistent strategy and the
[00:26] average gain has been. 3% with a win
[00:29] rate of 76 6% the gains are almost eight
[00:32] times better than for any random
[00:35] day what happens if the position is held
[00:37] until the close of Black Friday the day
[00:39] after
[00:40] Thanksgiving the average gain increases
[00:43] to 0.51% but as you can see the
[00:45] performance has decreased over the last
[00:48] decade let's go to the third and last
[00:51] Thanksgiving seasonal trading strategy
[00:53] this one has a significantly longer
[00:55] holding period than the first two
[00:57] ones we buy S&P 500 at the close of
[01:01] Monday before Thanksgiving and we hold
[01:03] the position until the beginning of the
[01:05] new year you might wonder why hold the
[01:08] position for so long and why sell on the
[01:10] third trading day of the new year that's
[01:13] because we want to take advantage of the
[01:15] gains during Christmas and the turn of
[01:16] the month stocks have historically
[01:19] performed well during Christmas but also
[01:21] at the end and beginning of a new month
[01:23] which is a strategy called turn of the
[01:25] month the next video coming up when we
[01:28] include both the Christmas and turn of
[01:30] the month effects holding S&P 500 from
[01:32] Thanksgiving until the new year is paid
[01:34] off well again we witness a remarkable
[01:37] consistency but the performance has
[01:39] weakened over the last decade the
[01:42] average gain is 2.68% which is almost
[01:45] three times better than any random
[01:46] period of similar
[01:48] length can the Thanksgiving seasonal
[01:51] strategy be improved or made different
[01:53] if you have any suggestions please
[01:55] comment good luck Trading
