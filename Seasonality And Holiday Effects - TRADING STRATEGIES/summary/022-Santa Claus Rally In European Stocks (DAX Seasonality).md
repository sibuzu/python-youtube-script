The trading strategy presented in the video involves capitalizing on a phenomenon known as the "Santa Claus Rally," which is observed not only in US stocks but also in European markets. Here's a concise summary of the strategy:

1. **Santa Claus Rally**: This refers to a historical tendency for stock prices, particularly in major indices like the US S&P 500, to rise around the Christmas holiday period.

2. **Focus on European Markets**:
   - The video examines whether a similar rally exists in German (DAX) and broader European stocks.
   - For German stocks, the ETF *EWG* is used as a proxy for the DAX index. The trading rules involve going long a few days before Christmas, specifically around the third Friday of December when DAX Futures expire. Positions are held until the last trading day of the year. Since inception, this strategy has yielded an 81% win rate with an average gain of 2.1%. However, gains have been diminishing over the past decade.
   - For broader European stocks, the ETF *FEZ* (tracking the STOXX Europe 50 Index) is used. The performance here mirrors that of German stocks, with an 81% win rate and an average gain of 1.5%.

3. **Position Management**:
   - Positions are typically held for about 6 to 10 days.
   - Entering the trade one week earlier increases the holding period but also enhances returns, albeit at the cost of more volatile earnings.

4. **Conclusion**: The video suggests that a Santa Claus Rally exists in European stocks, with the strategy showing consistent historical performance. It encourages viewers to engage by liking, subscribing, and commenting for more content.

This strategy appears to leverage historical market patterns around year-end holidays, aiming to capitalize on short-term price movements in liquid ETFs tracking major indices.
