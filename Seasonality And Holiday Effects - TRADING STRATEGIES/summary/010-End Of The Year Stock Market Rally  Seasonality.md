The trading strategy discussed in the video revolves around the concept of the "end-of-year stock market rally," which is often observed but sometimes questioned regarding its validity. Here's a concise summary of the strategy:

1. **Historical Background**: The speaker references the S&P 500 index and suggests that stock prices tend to rise toward the end of the year, indicating a consistent upward trend historically.

2. **Back Testing Strategies**:
   - **First Strategy**: Invest from the third Friday in December until the last trading day of the year. This approach has shown consistent performance since 1970, with profits in 68% of the years. The average gain is around 1%, which is considered favorable for an investment horizon of about 8 trading days.
   - **Second Strategy**: Go long at the close of the fifth last trading day of the year and sell at the closing print of the year. This method has not performed as well as the first strategy, but it still shows a consistent upward trend with the average winner being twice as large as the average loser.

3. **Conclusion**: The video concludes that there is evidence supporting the existence of an end-of-year stock market rally, though performance can vary between different strategies. It encourages viewers to engage by liking, subscribing, and commenting for more content.

However, as with any trading strategy, it's important to consider individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions before implementing such a plan.
