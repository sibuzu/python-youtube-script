The trading strategy presented in the video is based on a seasonal pattern where stocks tend to rally towards the end of each month and during the first few days of the new month. Here's a summary of the strategy:

1. **Entry Signal**:  
   Buy SP 500 on the fifth last trading day of the month.

2. **Exit Signal**:  
   Sell SP 500 on the third trading day of the new month.

3. **Investment Period**:  
   The strategy keeps you invested for only seven trading days per month (approximately 33% of the time), which reduces drawdowns significantly compared to a buy-and-hold approach.

4. **Performance**:  
   - Annual return: ~7% (vs. ~6.9% for buy-and-hold).  
   - Drawdowns: Reduced to 27% (vs. 56% for buy-and-hold).  
   The equity curve grows linearly, showing consistent growth with minimal setbacks.

5. **Improvement**:  
   The strategy has been optimized further by reducing the time invested in the market from 33% to 23%, while still achieving an annual return of ~6.7%. This improved version is available exclusively for subscribing members.
