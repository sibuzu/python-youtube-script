**Final Answer:**

The trading strategy known as the St. Patrick's Day Effect posits that stocks may perform well around March 17th, possibly due to the color green's positive connotations. The approach involves buying on the last trading day before St. Patrick's Day and selling on the holiday or the following trading day, with an investment horizon of one trading day.

**Key Points:**

1. **Strategy Overview**: 
   - Enter by purchasing on the last trading day before March 17th.
   - Exit by selling on March 17th or the subsequent trading day.

2. **Historical Performance**:
   - Since 1960, average gain is 21% with mixed results.
   - From 1993 onwards, average gain jumps to 53% with a 67% win rate.

3. **Caveats and Considerations**:
   - High daily gains (e.g., 53%) are unusually significant for a single trading day without major news.
   - Sample size may be too small, potentially leading to results influenced by chance.
   - Transaction costs could diminish returns over time.
   - Survivorship bias might skew the data presented.
   - No clear market fundamentals link St. Patrick's Day to stock performance; strategy appears more marketing-driven.

**Conclusion**: While intriguing, this strategy lacks consistent evidence of reliability and is not advisable for serious investing. It's better to focus on strategies with proven, longer-term consistency.
