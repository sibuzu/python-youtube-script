The trading strategy discussed in the video involves analyzing the stock market's performance during Ramadan, a significant Muslim holiday. The key points are:

1. **Ramadan Overview**: Ramadan is celebrated by many countries, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt, with dates varying each year based on the lunar calendar.

2. **Strategy for the S&P 500**:
   - If Ramadan starts on a weekend, buy the S&P 500 ETF (e.g., SPY) on the following Monday.
   - Sell after the holiday ends.
   - The strategy yields an annual return of approximately 1.1%, slightly better than a buy-and-hold approach over the tested period.

3. **Performance in Muslim Countries**:
   - Similar strategies were tested with ETFs from Saudi Arabia (KSA), Egypt (EGPT), and Turkey (TUR).
   - The results showed poor performance, with minimal or flat returns over 15 years.

4. **Conclusion**: While the strategy shows slight outperformance in the S&P 500, it underperforms in Muslim countries. The video emphasizes that this is one of many strategies available on their platform and encourages viewers to explore further.

This strategy highlights the importance of considering cultural and religious events when trading, though its effectiveness varies across different markets.
