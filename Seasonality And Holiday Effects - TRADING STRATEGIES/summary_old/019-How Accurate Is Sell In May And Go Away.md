The trading strategy "Sell in May and go away" is often cited as a way to avoid potential market downturns during certain months. Based on historical data, particularly from the S&P 500 index starting in 1960, the average gain in May has been relatively low compared to other months. Additionally, investing through the summer months (May to October) historically has resulted in minimal or even negative returns over the long term. Therefore, the strategy of selling in May and holding cash until October aligns with historical performance trends, suggesting that it has a basis in fact rather than being solely a myth.
