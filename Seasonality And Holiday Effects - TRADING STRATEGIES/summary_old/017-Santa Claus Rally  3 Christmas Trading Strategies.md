1. **Historical Performance**: The strategy involves backtesting data since 1960, showing that the last four trading days of the year and the first three days of January have historically yielded an average gain of 7% with a 66% win rate.

2. **Specific Trading Rules**:
   - One variation suggests going long (buying) on the second Friday of December and selling on the third trading day of the New Year, resulting in an average return of 1.6% per trade.
   - Another strategy involves buying at the close of the first trading day after December 20th and selling on January 1st, offering an average return of 1%.

3. **Consistency**: While not guaranteed, these strategies have shown consistent performance since at least 1960.

4. **Conclusion**: The Santa Claus Rally is one of several seasonal patterns in the stock market that traders might consider. However, it's important to note that past performance does not guarantee future results, and viewers are encouraged to engage with the content for more insights.
