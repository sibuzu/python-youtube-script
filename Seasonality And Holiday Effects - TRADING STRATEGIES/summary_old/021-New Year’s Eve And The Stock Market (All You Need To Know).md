The trading strategy discussed in the video examines whether there is a "New Year's Eve effect" in the stock market. Here's a summary of the strategy:

1. **Initial Approach**: 
   - Buy the S&P 500 on the close of the second-to-last trading day of the year.
   - Sell one day later, on the last trading day of the year.

2. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Since 1970, this strategy has shown erratic performance, indicating no consistent New Year's Eve effect in the stock market.

3. **Modified Strategy**:
   - Buy on the second-to-last trading day of the year.
   - Sell after holding for four days (i.e., selling on the third trading day of the new year).

4. **Results**:
   - This modified approach has yielded positive returns, but they are not consistently reliable.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - While there is no clear-cut New Year's Eve effect, optimism tends to persist into the New Year.

The video suggests that while celebrations and optimism around New Year's Eve might influence market sentiment, there isn't a definitive trading strategy based solely on this event.
