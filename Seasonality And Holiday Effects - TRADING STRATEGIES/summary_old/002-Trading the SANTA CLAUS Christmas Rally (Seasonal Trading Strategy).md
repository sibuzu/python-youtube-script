The trading strategy revolves around capitalizing on the "Santa Claus Rally" phenomenon, which refers to a stock market rally that typically occurs near the end of December and into early January. However, this strategy specifically targets gold prices, noting that gold has historically experienced a stronger Santa Claus Rally over the past 20 years compared to stocks.

### Key Components of the Strategy:
1. **Entry Point**:  
   - Buy gold at the close of the options expiration day in December. Options expiration days are typically around the third Friday of each month, but the exact date can vary depending on market conditions and holidays.

2. **Exit Point**:  
   - Sell gold at the close of the first trading day of the New Year (January 1st).

3. **Performance**:  
   - The strategy has delivered an average return of over two percent per trade since the year 2000.

4. **Backtesting**:  
   - The strategy was backtested in a video, and similar analyses are conducted in their weekly newsletter available at [Quantified Strategies](https://quantifiedstrategies.com). Backtesting involves using historical data to validate the effectiveness of the strategy.

### Summary:
