The trading strategy revolves around the Valentine's Day rally, where historical data suggests that stock markets, particularly emerging markets, tend to show abnormal positive returns in the days leading up to February 14th. The strategy involves:

1. Going long (buying) in February when the calendar day is 10 or higher.
2. Selling at the close on February 14th or the first trading day after if the 14th is not a trading day.

The backtesting results indicate an average gain of 0.35% over about three trading days for the S&P 500, which is higher than random periods. Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) shows an even stronger performance with an average gain of 1.4%. This strategy leverages seasonal market patterns to capitalize on potential price movements during this period.
