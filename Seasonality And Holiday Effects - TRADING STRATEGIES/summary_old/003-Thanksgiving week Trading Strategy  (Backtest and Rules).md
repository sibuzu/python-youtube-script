The trading strategy discussed involves taking advantage of stock performance during the Thanksgiving week in the United States. The key points are:

1. **Entry and Exit Points**: 
   - Investors are advised to buy stocks on the Friday before Thanksgiving (often referred to as "Turkey Day") and exit positions on Black Friday, which is typically the following Friday.
   - Another variation suggests entering at the close of trading on Tuesday during Thanksgiving week and exiting on Black Friday.

2. **Historical Performance**:
   - The strategy shows a consistent average return of about 0.6% over this period.
   - There is also a mention that bond yields tend to fall during this time, which inversely affects bond prices, making them stronger.

3. **Reminder**:
   - The video creator promotes a weekly strategy report sent via inbox every Sunday or Monday morning, priced at $99 annually.

The strategy appears to leverage seasonal market patterns observed during Thanksgiving week, suggesting that stocks and bonds may perform well during this period due to various factors, including investor behavior and economic indicators. However, the creator also notes that returns have been slowly eroding over time, indicating potential diminishing effectiveness of the strategy. 

As always, traders should consider their risk tolerance, diversify their investments, and remain cautious of market volatility.
