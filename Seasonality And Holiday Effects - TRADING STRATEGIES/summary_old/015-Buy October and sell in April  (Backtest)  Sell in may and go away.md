The trading strategy described involves taking advantage of a seasonal tendency in the stock market. Here's a summary:

1. **Seasonal Tendency**: The trader refers to a known pattern where stocks tend to underperform from May to October ( Memorial Day to Labor Day). This period is sometimes called "Sell in May and Go Away."

2. **Strategy**:
   - Buy at the end of April.
   - Sell at the end of October.
   - Avoid holding during the summer months when returns are historically low.

3. **Backtesting**: The strategy was backtested on the S&P 500 (SPX) from 1960 to present, showing that this approach has worked well over time with returns being close to zero during the May-October period.

4. **Rationale**: The trader prefers using statistics and historical data rather than relying on emotions or market sentiment, especially in rough markets.

This strategy aims to capitalize on the seasonal weakness in stock prices during the summer months.
