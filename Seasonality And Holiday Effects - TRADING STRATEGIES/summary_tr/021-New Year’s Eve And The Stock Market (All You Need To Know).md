视频中讨论的交易策略检查了是否有 "New Year's Eve effect" 在股市。 这是该策略的摘要：

1. **初始方法** ：
   - Buy the S&P 500 on the close of the second-to-last trading day of the year.
   - Sell one day later, on the last trading day of the year.

2. **绩效分析** ：
   - Since 1970, this strategy has shown erratic performance, indicating no consistent New Year's Eve effect in the stock market.

3. **修改的策略** ：
   - Buy on the second-to-last trading day of the year.
   -持有四天后出售（即在新年的第三交易日出售）。

4. **结果** ：
   - This modified approach has yielded positive returns, but they are not consistently reliable.

5. **结论** ：
   - While there is no clear-cut New Year's Eve effect, optimism tends to persist into the New Year.

该视频表明，虽然除夕周围的庆祝活动和乐观可能会影响市场情绪，但仅基于此事件而没有确定的交易策略。
