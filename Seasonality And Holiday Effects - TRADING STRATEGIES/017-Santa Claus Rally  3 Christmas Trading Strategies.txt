[00:01] today we're going to talk about one of
[00:03] the most anticipated periods in the
[00:04] stock market the Santa Claus rally the
[00:08] Santa rally refers to the presumably
[00:10] consistent pattern of market gains that
[00:12] happens over the Christmas period is
[00:15] this a myth or is there a Santa Claus
[00:17] rally in the stock market it turns out
[00:20] there is a Santa Claus rally and on the
[00:21] screen you can see the results of the
[00:23] three back tests we make in this
[00:26] video the first back test looks at the
[00:28] performance of the last four trading
[00:30] days of the year in the first three days
[00:32] of the New Year the performance has
[00:35] overall been good since 1960 but the
[00:38] last decade has been difficult the
[00:40] average gain is 7% with a 66% win
[00:45] ratio let's change the trading rules and
[00:47] go long at the second Friday of December
[00:50] and sell on the third trading day of the
[00:52] New
[00:53] Year the strategy has produced 1.6% per
[00:57] trade and has been remarkably consistent
[00:59] since at least
[01:01] 1960 let's look at the third and last
[01:03] Santa Claus rally back test we go long
[01:06] at the close of the first trading day
[01:08] after the 20th of December and sell on
[01:11] the first trading day of the New Year
[01:14] this Santa Claus trading strategy has
[01:16] returned 1% per trade with consistency
[01:19] although it's far from a sure thing
[01:22] overall the Santa Claus rally in stocks
[01:24] is one of many strong seasonal
[01:26] patterns if you like this video please
