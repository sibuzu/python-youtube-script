[00:01] sell in May and go away is a well-known
[00:04] saying in finance is this a myth or a
[00:07] fact the saying actually makes sense
[00:10] based on historical performance and in
[00:12] this video we show you the evidence to
[00:14] back it up first let's look at how S&P
[00:17] 500 has performed in the month of May
[00:19] since
[00:20] 1960 the average gain is1 18% which is
[00:24] the fourth worst performance of any
[00:26] month and clearly the performance has
[00:28] not been consistent but ra erratic the
[00:31] table on the screen indicates that these
[00:33] summer months have been poor with the
[00:35] exception of July let's find out what
[00:37] happens if we're invested only from May
[00:39] until October the five summer months if
[00:43] you invested
[00:44] $100,000 back in 1960 you would only
[00:47] have
[00:48] $97,000 today in other words you would
[00:50] have lost money this means that sell in
[00:53] May and go away has a lot of Truth in it
[00:57] Opposite if you invest in October and
[00:59] sell in May you would have captured all
[01:01] the gains in the stock market since
[01:04] 1960 good luck trading and
[01:08] investing
