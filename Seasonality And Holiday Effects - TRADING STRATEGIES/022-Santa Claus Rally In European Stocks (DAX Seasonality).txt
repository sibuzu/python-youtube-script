[00:01] US Stocks have historically performed
[00:03] well over the Christmas period something
[00:05] which is referred to as the Santa Claus
[00:07] rally is there a similar Santa Claus
[00:10] rally in Dax and European
[00:13] stocks it is and in this video we show
[00:17] you first we look at German stocks and
[00:19] we back test the ETF with the ticker
[00:22] code
[00:23] ewg the ETF is very liquid and has been
[00:26] trading since
[00:28] 1996 We Believe WG is a great proxy for
[00:31] the German Dax index the trading rules
[00:34] are simple we go long a few days before
[00:38] Christmas on the third Friday of
[00:39] December which is the date when the Dax
[00:42] Futures expire we sell at the last
[00:45] trading day of the
[00:47] year since Inception we've had 81%
[00:50] winning trades with an average gain of
[00:52] 2.1% however over the last decade we see
[00:55] that the gains have been
[00:57] diminishing let's look at the Euro stock
[00:59] STX 50 a heavily traded index of
[01:01] European blue chips from 11 countries in
[01:04] the Euro Zone we back test the ETF with
[01:07] the ticker code Fez which tracks the
[01:10] index we use the same trading rules
[01:12] again and the performance since
[01:14] Inception in 2002 is also impressive the
[01:17] win rate is 81% and the average gain has
[01:20] been an impressive
[01:22] 1.5% clearly there's a Santa Claus rally
[01:25] in European stocks the positions are
[01:28] held on average for about 6 to 10 days
[01:31] however if we enter the position one
[01:33] week earlier the holding period
[01:35] increases but the returns also go up but
[01:38] at the price of more volatile earnings
