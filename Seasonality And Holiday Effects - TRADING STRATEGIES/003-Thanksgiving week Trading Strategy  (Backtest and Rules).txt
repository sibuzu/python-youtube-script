[00:01] foreign
[00:02] so next week is the Thanksgiving week
[00:07] so
[00:08] we thought we'd like to make some back
[00:10] tests so the stocks have performed
[00:12] during this week
[00:14] so here
[00:15] we have we made a tweet
[00:18] or actually several tweets on Twitter
[00:21] and here is here is the back test
[00:24] showing the performance if you buy the
[00:27] clothes on the Friday
[00:30] I repeat if you buy the clothes on the
[00:32] Friday before Thanksgiving week and you
[00:35] exit on the on the Black Friday
[00:39] so the performance as you can see here
[00:42] is pretty consistent about 0.6 percent
[00:46] on average
[00:49] uh one of the reasons why you have this
[00:52] Tailwind in stocks during this week
[00:55] might be because they yield or long-term
[00:58] bonds usually fall during this week
[01:02] this is the equity curve of the yield
[01:06] of long-term bonds and when yield goes
[01:10] down
[01:11] it means that the price of the bomb goes
[01:14] up so it's an inverse relationship
[01:20] so that means that bonds also is pretty
[01:22] strong during Thanksgiving week
[01:25] so to to end this short video we put up
[01:30] a short hair or an equity curve if you
[01:33] buy the clothes on Tuesday
[01:37] or the Thanksgiving week and you exit on
[01:41] the at the close on the Black Friday so
[01:44] I repeat
[01:45] you enter at the close on Tuesday
[01:50] in the Thanksgiving week and you exit on
[01:53] Black Friday
[01:54] so here you can see the performance has
[01:57] been pretty consistent
[02:01] except for perhaps it seems like it's uh
[02:05] slowly eroding a little bit
[02:08] so and I also take the opportunity to
[02:11] remind you that we have a strategy
[02:13] report that we publish every weekend on
[02:16] a Sunday or Monday morning and it's and
[02:19] we send it to your um in inbox every
[02:23] week 52 times per year
[02:26] um we would say it's a pretty cheap
[02:28] report only 99 US dollar
[02:33] good luck
