[00:00] do you want to maximize your return on
[00:02] investments
[00:04] we'll show you the exact price of
[00:06] missing a few days in the stock market
[00:09] jpmorgan's Asset Management recently put
[00:12] an exact price to these missed days
[00:15] let's take a look at what happens when
[00:18] you invest ten thousand dollars into the
[00:20] S P 500 on January 3rd year 2000 and you
[00:24] leave it completely invested in 20 years
[00:26] you would have received an average
[00:28] annual return of just over six percent
[00:30] to ten thousand dollars would have grown
[00:32] to 32 421 this 20-year period of time
[00:37] includes roughly 5 000 days during which
[00:40] the stock market was open but if you had
[00:42] missed just the 10 best days out of
[00:45] those five thousand you would have less
[00:47] than half as much money left that's
[00:49] right miss the best 20 days and you
[00:52] would barely have made any money at all
[00:54] so what's the lesson learned here
[00:58] the lesson is that staying invested is
[01:00] the key to long-term success No Matter
[01:04] What markets are doing stay invested you
[01:07] never know when those best days will hit
[01:09] and the more you miss out on the more
[01:12] money you'll be leaving on the table
[01:14] so if you want to maximize your return
[01:16] Stay invested
