[00:01] can the stock market's performance in
[00:03] January indicate the performance the
[00:05] rest of the
[00:06] year yes in an article on our web page
[00:09] Quantified strategies.com we showed you
[00:11] how the January barometer indicates the
[00:13] performance the remaining 11 months in
[00:16] this video we'll show you the trading
[00:18] rules and why the January barometer
[00:20] offers good risk and reward on the left
[00:23] you see the performance of S&P 500 when
[00:26] the January barometer indicates you
[00:28] should buy and on the right you see the
[00:30] performance when it says you should keep
[00:32] your money in the bank as you can see
[00:34] the difference in the equity curves is
[00:36] pretty
[00:37] substantial let's define the trading
[00:40] rules if the close of January is higher
[00:43] than the close of December we buy S&P
[00:45] 500 and stay invested until the end of
[00:48] the year which is 11 months if the close
[00:50] is lower we stay in cash if the January
[00:54] barometer flashes a Buy Signal we get a
[00:56] steady Rising Equity curve from 1960
[00:59] until today
[01:00] the average gain is 10.5% not
[01:03] considering dividends and this is
[01:04] substantially better than any random
[01:06] 11-month period the reason for the good
[01:09] performance is that losing years only
[01:11] drop 8% on average while the winning
[01:14] years rise almost
[01:16] 15% if the January barometer shows a
[01:19] negative signal the performance the rest
[01:21] of the year is clearly not good the
[01:24] average gain is only 2.6% which is way
[01:27] below the average random gains the
[01:29] reason for the poor performance is that
[01:31] during losing years S&P 500 drops almost
[01:35] 16% on average while the winning years
[01:38] rise only
[01:39] 133% hence the risk and reward is poor
[01:43] that's all for today and good luck
