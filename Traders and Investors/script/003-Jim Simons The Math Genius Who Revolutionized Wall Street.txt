[02:49] of assets like stocks Futures
[02:51] Commodities currencies and even
[02:53] cryptocurrencies they're unique because
[02:55] they hire experts in math and physics
[02:57] known as quants who play a crucial role
[03:00] in the group's remarkable success these

[03:04] calculations to make intelligent
[03:06] investment choices so what is the secret

[04:17] guessing three data is gold the more the
[04:20] merrier four they skip the why and

[04:57] strategies trade actively not passively
[05:00] they're masters of short-term data
[05:02] driven trades pairs trading and
[05:04] neutrality powered by math and physics
[05:06] expertise why short-term the strategy
[05:09] was clear they needed massive data sets
[05:11] to find meaningful patterns for example
[05:13] for annual data they only have 100
[05:16] observations over a 100 years this is
[05:18] too little to make any significant
[05:19] models and thus they look for shortterm
[05:22] patterns involving massive data sets but
[05:25] the real trick knowing when to stop
[05:27] avoiding the compounding limit trading
[05:29] lover have you ever heard of this
[05:30] masterpiece book by Gregory Zuckerman

[05:35] Simons and the history of The Medallion
[05:37] fund however it reveals few of Simon
[05:40] trading Secrets due to the manager's
[05:41] secrecy Simons himself is maintained a
[05:44] lowprofile and hasn't published trading
[05:46] insights likely to safeguard his
[05:48] strategies from public view but for you
[05:50] guys we've summarized the main takeaways
[05:52] from the book in the 1970s James Simons
[05:55] faced early struggles in trading as his
[05:57] strategies needed more practical
[05:59] experience and were too focused on
[06:01] Commodities despite their Simon Axe and
[06:05] bomb mathematical expertise Simons and
[06:07] his team needed a deeper understanding
[06:09] of the markets they initially had trust
[06:11] issues with their strategies and often
[06:13] interfered causing setbacks the Turning
[06:16] Point came in 1988 when Simons launched
[06:18] The Medallion fund aiming to use vast
[06:21] data to create strategies across various
[06:23] markets and time frames for
[06:25] diversification in the early 1990s the
[06:28] Breakthrough occurred with the high ing
[06:29] of Bob Mercer and Peter Brown from IBM
[06:32] but it was in the 2000s that they truly
[06:34] hit the jackpot in stock trading Mercer
[06:37] became well known for his involvement in
[06:39] politics in 2016 which eventually led to
[06:42] him leaving the company in 2017 in
[06:44] Gregory zuckerman's book The Man Who
[06:46] solved the market he provides us with a
[06:48] fascinating look at the annual returns

[07:45] management and performance fees over the
[07:47] years it continued to provide impressive
[07:49] returns even during challenging times in
[07:51] the financial markets it's important to
[07:53] note that most of the funds investors
[07:55] are its own employees including Jim
[07:57] Simons himself who estimated wealth is
[08:00] in the range of 20 to30 billion other
[08:03] key figures often referred to as the
[08:05] lieutenants like Peter Brown and Bob
[08:07] Mercer are also believed to be
[08:09] billionaires thanks to the fund's
[08:10] extraordinary success The Medallion fund
[08:13] always used substantial leverage often
[08:15] 10 times or even 20 times its equity
[08:17] which contributed to its remarkable
[08:19] returns however in 2007 the fund faced a
[08:22] dire situation they narrowly escaped a
[08:26] crisis when a group of stocks suddenly
[08:28] dropped in value forcing them to provide
[08:30] additional collateral to prevent a
[08:32] forced sale they were on the brink of
[08:34] margin calls and the banks could have
[08:35] suffered significant losses it was a
[08:37] close call and had the market not turned
[08:39] in their favor Medallion might have met
[08:41] a similar fate to ltcm luck played a
[08:44] crucial role in their escape from this
[08:46] tail risk scenario sparing them and
[08:49] preventing potential Ripple effects in
[08:51] the financial system what can we learn
[08:53] from Jim Simon's Incredible Journey it's
[08:56] not just about math it's about
[08:57] persistently seeking opportunities and
[09:00] embracing quantitative strategies

[09:04] markets and time frames is critical
[09:06] Simons emphasizes that there's no data
[09:09] like more data also always appreciate
[09:11] the power of math over intuition The
[09:14] Medallion fund success lies in the
