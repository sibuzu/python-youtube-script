[02:22] past 20 years
[02:23] 1987 stock market crisis popularly known
[02:26] as Black Monday was when Paul Tudor
[02:29] Jones experienced his most tremendous
[02:31] success
[02:32] Global stock markets fell on that

[03:25] consumer discretionary and now also
[03:27] Bitcoin he is at times had several
[03:30] hundreds of equities and holdings
[03:32] it's hardly surprising that Paul Tudor
[03:35] Jones has expanded the diversification
[03:36] of his Holdings by investing in
[03:38] cryptocurrencies
[03:39] he stated that he invested in Bitcoin in
[03:41] 2020 and currently has a small
[03:44] proportion of cryptocurrencies in his
[03:45] portfolio
[03:47] in Jones's opinion cryptocurrency is a
[03:50] better inflation hedge than gold
[03:57] as part of his trading method Paul Tudor
[03:59] Jones uses a variety of strategies to
[04:01] spot Market opportunities several of
[04:03] these methods include
[04:06] technical analysis and mass psychology
[04:09] which include forecasting future market
[04:11] prices by examining previous price
[04:13] patterns are the foundation of Jones
[04:15] trading method
[04:17] he argues that human emotions Drive
[04:19] Market fluctuations and have a tendency
[04:21] to repeat themselves he looks closely at
[04:23] past Market data to find patterns that
[04:25] might be utilized to predict future
[04:27] price changes his precise forecasting of
[04:30] significant Market crashes shows this
[04:32] method's effectiveness
[04:33] Paul Tudor Jones and his co-worker Peter
[04:36] Boris linked the market during the 1987
[04:38] stock market disaster to the
[04:40] circumstances before the 1929 stock
[04:43] market crash they could perform one of
[04:45] wall Street's most impressive moves
[04:47] because of this investigation which
[04:49] found startling connections perhaps his
[04:51] favorite indicator is the 200-day moving
[04:53] average
[04:54] Joan said in an interview with the
[04:56] famous Trend following writer Michael
[04:57] Cavell that this simple indicator is the
[05:00] metric that starts all his research why
[05:02] is this
[05:03] that's because the 200-day moving
[05:05] average has worked very well to filter
[05:07] bullish and bearish Market regimes it
[05:10] keeps you out of trouble and avoids many
[05:12] nasty drawdowns we assume that Paul
[05:14] Tudor Jones trading strategy is a bit
[05:16] more sophisticated than just this filter
[05:18] but it shows that even the simplest
[05:20] things can contribute for example this
[05:22] filter flashed a sell signal just days
[05:25] before the Black Monday in 1987. another
[05:28] example is when the 200-day average
[05:30] avoided most of the bear Market from
[05:32] 2000 to 2003.
[05:34] a sell signal flashed again in early
[05:36] 2008 and would have kept you out of the
[05:39] market until the summer of 2009. now in
[05:42] the last example you can see some false
[05:44] signals this is not a guaranteed
[05:45] indicator and you must expect whip songs
[05:48] but the examples here are not
[05:50] cherry-picked if we apply these simple
[05:52] rules of buying S P 500 when it closes
[05:55] above the 200-day moving average and
[05:57] sell when it closes below we conclude
[06:00] that the 200-day average strategy is
[06:02] performed at just a tad worse than Buy
[06:03] and Hold S P 500 however you would have
[06:06] got that result by suffering a lot less
[06:08] along the way Max loss was 26 percent
[06:11] while Buy and Hold suffered a 50 loss
[06:14] three times during this period as seen
[06:16] on the left chart
[06:17] on the screen you can see the
[06:19] performance of the 200-day average
[06:21] filter on the right
[06:25] Jones also strongly believes in global
[06:28] macro trading which is taking positions
[06:29] in international financial markets based
[06:32] on societal and governmental changes he
[06:34] believes that this tactic offers the
[06:36] best chance of generating profits this
[06:38] mindset has been crucial in his most
[06:40] extensive and successful deals Jones
[06:42] prefers to use the Futures Market
[06:44] instead of the stock market when using
[06:46] this method because he thinks it offers
[06:48] more liquidity and better hedging
[06:49] options
[06:51] [Music]
[06:54] Jones practices active money management
[06:57] which involves closely observing the
[06:58] performance of a portfolio of
[07:00] Investments and promptly deciding
[07:02] whether to acquire hold or sell assets
[07:04] the goal is to beat typical stock market
[07:06] returns and profit on transient price
[07:09] wings this method is part of Paul Tudor
[07:11] Jones trading strategy since he
[07:13] carefully monitors his Holdings to
[07:15] guarantee their success he immediately
[07:17] sells off under performing assets and
[07:20] looks for other ones to invest in
[07:24] Paul Tudor Jones is undoubtedly one of
[07:26] the best Traders on Wall Street he rose
[07:28] to popularity after earning over a
[07:30] hundred million dollars after the Black
[07:32] Monday crisis due to his successes and
[07:34] Adept risk management an area where many
[07:37] Traders struggle
[07:38] he's made a reputation for himself by
[07:40] persistently pushing the limits of
[07:42] success driven by a hunger for Challenge
[07:44] and competitiveness
