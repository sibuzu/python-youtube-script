The trading strategy summarized is based on replicating the investment approach of Ivy League university endowments, as outlined in the book *Ivy Portfolio* by Meb Faber and Eric W. Richardson. The strategy involves creating a diversified portfolio with allocations to stocks, bonds, and commodities, aiming for long-term growth with lower volatility compared to the S&P 500.

### Key Components:
1. **Portfolio Allocation**:
   - Stocks: ~60%
   - Intermediate Bonds: ~20%
   - Commodities: Remaining percentage (~20%)

2. **Objective**: To replicate the performance of Ivy League endowments, which are known for their long-term, diversified approach.

3. **Historical Performance**:
   - The portfolio has an inflation-adjusted return above 4%.
   - Standard deviation is lower than that of the S&P 500, indicating lower volatility.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Use five ETFs with equal allocations (20% each) to approximate the Ivy Portfolio's performance.
   - The example includes specific ETFs for exposure to stocks, bonds, and commodities.

5. **Backtesting Results**:
   - From 2008, the annual return was ~4.6%, slightly below historical averages due to poor commodity performance.
   - The portfolio dropped by 45% during the financial crisis in 2008.

### Conclusion:
The strategy emphasizes long-term investing and diversification, aiming for steady growth rather than high returns. While it may not "set the world on fire," it provides a balanced approach with lower risk.
