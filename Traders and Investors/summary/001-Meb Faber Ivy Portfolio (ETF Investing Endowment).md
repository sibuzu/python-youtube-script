The trading strategy described is based on replicating the investment approach of Ivy League university endowments, as outlined in the book "Ivy Portfolio" by Meb Faber and Eric W. Richardson. Here's a summary:

1. **Objective**: To replicate the performance of diversified portfolios similar to those managed by institutions like Yale University, known for their long-term, conservative investing approach.

2. **Portfolio Structure**:
   - **60% Stocks**: Typically in low-cost equity ETFs.
   - **20% Intermediate Bonds**: In bond ETFs focusing on intermediate-term bonds.
   - **20% Commodities**: Split into Gold, Silver, Copper, and Crude Oil ETFs.

3. **Performance**:
   - The strategy aims for a moderate return (around 4-5%) with lower volatility compared to the S&P 500.
   - Backtested from 2008 onwards, the annualized return is approximately 4.6%, but it notes that commodity performance has been abysmal in recent years.

4. **Drawbacks**:
   - The portfolio experienced a significant drop of 45% during the financial crisis in 2008.
   - Returns are modest and may not outpace inflation or other high-risk investments.

5. **Conclusion**: The strategy is designed for long-term, conservative investors who prefer stability over high returns. It emphasizes the importance of time and compounding for growth but acknowledges past weaknesses, particularly in commodity performance.

The video suggests using a portfolio of five ETFs with equal allocations (20% each) to approximate this strategy, highlighting its balanced approach but cautioning about potential drawdowns during market crises.
