The trading strategy outlined in "Ivy Portfolio" by Meb Faber and Eric W. Richardson aims to replicate the performance of Ivy League university endowments, such as Yale's, through a portfolio of five ETFs each allocated 20% equally. Despite its long-term replication goals, the strategy experienced underperformance with an annual return of 4.6%, below historical averages, primarily due to commodities' poor performance between 2015 and 2018.
