**Summary of the Ivy Portfolio Trading Strategy**

The Ivy Portfolio trading strategy, introduced by Meb Faber and Eric W. Richardson in their 2009 book *Ivy Portfolio*, aims to replicate the investment performance of endowments managed by Ivy League universities, such as Yale's. The strategy involves creating a diversified portfolio using five ETFs, each allocated 20% to mimic the endowment model.

**Key Features:**
- **Objective:** To mirror the returns of ivy league university endowments.
- **Portfolio Composition:** Consists of five ETFs with equal weighting (20% each).
- **Recent Performance:** Delivered an annual return of 4.6%, below historical averages, largely due to poor commodity performance in 2015 and 2016.
- **Expectations:** Longer-term normalization of returns is anticipated.

This strategy leverages the diversification and long-term investment approach typical of endowments, with a focus on rebalancing to maintain equal allocations.
