[00:00] in 2009 Meb Faber and Eric W Richardson
[00:03] released a book called Ivy portfolio
[00:06] which outlines an investment strategy
[00:08] that seeks to replicate the performance
[00:09] of a basket of endowments such as those
[00:12] of ivy league universities for example
[00:15] yales we made a portfolio of five ETFs
[00:18] that we believe are close to achieving
[00:20] the same return as any IV portfolios we
[00:23] use the five ETFs that you see on the
[00:26] screen each with an equal allocation of
[00:28] 20% the annual return is 4.6% which is
[00:32] significantly below the historical
[00:33] average and this is mainly due to the
[00:36] abysmal performance of commodities
