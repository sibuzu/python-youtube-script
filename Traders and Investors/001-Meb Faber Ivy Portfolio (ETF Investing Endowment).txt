[00:01] in 2009 Meb Faber and Eric W Richardson
[00:04] released a book called Ivy portfolio
[00:07] which outlines an investment strategy
[00:09] that seeks to replicate the performance
[00:11] of a basket of endowments such as those
[00:13] of ivy league universities for example
[00:16] yales ivy league universities have
[00:19] consistently outperformed the market
[00:21] over time due to their Diversified
[00:23] portfolios and long-term investment
[00:26] Horizon an Ivy League portfolio consists
[00:28] of a mix of stocks often about 60% an
[00:31] intermediate Bond allocation of 20% and
[00:34] the rest in
[00:35] Commodities historically such a
[00:37] diversified portfolio has performed well
[00:41] the inflation adjusted return is above
[00:43] 4% with a standard deviation below that
[00:46] of the S&P 500 perhaps the returns won't
[00:50] set the world on fire but the portfolio
[00:52] is obtained exactly what it was supposed
[00:55] to
[00:56] do just give it time and it'll snowball
[01:00] how can you set up an IV portfolio
[01:02] yourself we made a portfolio of five
[01:05] ETFs that we believe are close to
[01:07] achieving the same return as any ivv
[01:10] portfolios we use the five ETFs that you
[01:12] see on the screen each with an equal
[01:14] allocation of
[01:16] 20% how is such an IV portfolio of ETFs
[01:20] performed we back tested it from
[01:23] 2008 the annual return is 4.6% which is
[01:27] significantly below the historical
[01:28] average and this is mainly due to the
[01:31] abysmal performance of
[01:33] Commodities most years are positive but
[01:35] the financial crisis in 2008 made the
[01:38] portfolio drop 45% at the
[01:42] maximum if you like our video please
