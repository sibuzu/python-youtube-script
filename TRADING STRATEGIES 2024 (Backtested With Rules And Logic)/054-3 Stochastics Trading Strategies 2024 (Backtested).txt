[00:00] today we'll show you three stochastic
[00:02] trading strategies we'll give you the
[00:04] specific trading rules and the back
[00:06] tested
[00:07] performance you can see the equity
[00:09] curves of the three stochastic trading
[00:11] strategies on the screen so please make
[00:13] sure you stick to the end to get the
[00:15] trading rules before we start what is
[00:18] the stochastic trading indicator
[00:20] stochastics measures the recent strength
[00:23] of the stock and how it trades compared
[00:25] to the last end days it measures the
[00:27] movement and how it fares today compared
[00:30] to the look back periods high and low
[00:32] readings if the current price is low
[00:34] compared to the high low range over the
[00:37] preceding n days the reading is low and
[00:40] vice versa and thus it oscillates from
[00:42] overbought to oversold levels if you
[00:45] want to know more please click on the
[00:47] link below the
[00:49] video let's go to the first stochastic
[00:51] trading strategy we use a two-day value
[00:55] of the fast tastic variable and we buy
[00:57] the close when it hits 25 or lower we
[01:00] sell on a day with strength where the
[01:02] close ends higher than yesterday's high
[01:06] when we back test these two trading
[01:07] rules on NASDAQ 100 we get a pretty
[01:09] stable Equity curve as indicated on the
[01:12] screen the average gain is 76% per trade
[01:16] which gives you a wide margin of safety
[01:18] to cover slippage and commissions note
[01:20] that you're invested only 26% of the
[01:23] time let's go to the second stochastic
[01:26] trading strategy we increased the look
[01:29] back period for from 2 to 3 days and buy
[01:32] when the fast stochastic indicator
[01:33] crosses below 20 we use the same sell
[01:36] trigger as in the previous back test
[01:39] when we back test the trading rules on
[01:41] TLT the ETF that tracks long-term
[01:44] treasury bonds we get a pretty good and
[01:46] linear Equity curve however the average
[01:50] per trade is much lower than for Equity
[01:53] ETFs let's go to our third and last of
[01:56] our stochastic trading strategies we use
[01:59] the same Trading rules as in the
[02:00] previous strategy but we lower the buy
[02:02] threshold to 15 and back test the ETF
[02:05] that tracks Consumer Staples which is
[02:09] xlp as expected you get a lot fewer
[02:12] trades but the average gain per trade is
[02:14] high at
[02:16] 76% Max draw down is also pretty low at
[02:19] only 12% and the risk adjusted return is
[02:22] high at 40% because the strategy's only
[02:25] invested 8% of the time we've now shown
[02:28] you three to ftic trading strategies and
[02:31] we hope they help you to generate
[02:32] trading ideas and strategies
