[00:00] today we're looking at a strategy which
[00:03] has a 91 win rate the name of the
[00:06] strategy is triple RSI trading strategy
[00:10] we called it RSI trading strategy
[00:12] because it's based on the relative
[00:14] strength indicator here you can see the
[00:18] equity curve or the back test we did we
[00:21] will come back to the back test
[00:24] so what's the strategy about
[00:26] well the trading strategy is about
[00:29] exploiting pullbacks in the long-term
[00:32] Rising Trend because the stock market
[00:34] normally goes up because of inflation
[00:37] and productivity gains
[00:40] and here we have put in a chart for you
[00:43] which shows the U.S stock market from
[00:46] 1850 until today
[00:49] however nothing is linear and as you can
[00:52] see here you have
[00:54] some panics along the way
[00:57] and the strategy looks for short-term
[00:59] pullbacks where we're invested just a
[01:01] few days per trade
[01:04] let's look at the trading rules so we
[01:07] are interested in back testing the stock
[01:09] market and as a proxy for the stock
[01:11] market we use S P 500 and the ETF with
[01:14] the ticker code spy
[01:17] and this one is called spider
[01:21] the trading rules are like this
[01:24] the five-day RSI is below 30. the 5-day
[01:29] RSI reading is down for the third day in
[01:32] a row the five-day RSI was below 63
[01:37] trading days ago and the close is higher
[01:40] than the 200-day moving average
[01:43] and the last rule is
[01:46] we put in as a filter for Trend we only
[01:50] want to have it when it's in a rising
[01:52] Trend and the 200-day moving average is
[01:56] pretty good at filtering this so the
[01:58] exit is when the 5-day RSI is above 50.
[02:03] let's look at a trade example
[02:06] and you can see here this line which is
[02:09] the 200-day moving average
[02:12] and here you can see the the Green Arrow
[02:15] which is a Buy Signal and the red arrow
[02:18] which is the cell signal
[02:21] now let's switch to Amy broker where we
[02:24] did the back test here you can see the
[02:27] trade list
[02:29] so it's not many trades it's it's just
[02:32] 78 78 trades over this time period
[02:37] so let's end this video with the back
[02:39] test results there are 78 trades since
[02:42] 1993 so it's not money the average gain
[02:46] per trade is 1.4 percent
[02:49] 91 of the trades are winners and you are
[02:52] invested on average just six days per
[02:55] trade
[02:56] so overall we would say this this is a
[02:59] pretty good result
[03:00] if you want more trading strategies we
[03:02] have hundreds of them on our webpage
