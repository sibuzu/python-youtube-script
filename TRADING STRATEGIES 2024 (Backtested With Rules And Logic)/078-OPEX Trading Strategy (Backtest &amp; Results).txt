[00:00] welcome to Quantified strategies
[00:03] today we're talking about the options
[00:05] expiration week effect often abbreviated
[00:07] Opex week and the term we'll mostly use
[00:10] in this video
[00:11] what is it when is it and can you make
[00:13] money during this week
[00:15] stick around and we'll answer all these
[00:17] questions for you in this video that
[00:19] contains three back-tested trading
[00:21] strategies
[00:22] by the way we're always working hard to
[00:24] create new and exciting content so your
[00:26] likes and subscriptions really help us
[00:28] up
[00:29] let's start by showing the performance
[00:31] of s p 500 during any Opex week
[00:34] as a proxy for S P 500 we use the ETF
[00:37] with the ticker code spy
[00:40] the trading rules are simple
[00:42] we buy the Monday open of the Opex week
[00:44] and we sell at the close of the Opex day
[00:48] the result is not a straight line but
[00:50] it's sloping upwards by being invested
[00:53] only during the options expiration week
[00:55] you more than double your Capital over
[00:57] the period you made 153 percent
[01:01] the cagr which is the compound annual
[01:03] growth rate during the options
[01:05] expiration week is 3.1 percent and the
[01:08] average gain is 0.3 percent per week
[01:10] higher than any other random week
[01:13] based on this we can argue that there is
[01:15] an Opex weak effect
[01:17] keep in mind that you're invested only
[01:19] around 18 of the time and the average
[01:21] number of bars in a trade is slightly
[01:23] less than five while it may not be a
[01:26] Surefire way to get rich quick it's
[01:28] still a promising option in our opinion
[01:30] so there you have it folks our back test
[01:32] confirms that there's an options
[01:34] expiration week effect and while it's
[01:36] not a standalone strategy it can be used
[01:38] in conjunction with other parameters to
[01:40] make profitable trades
[01:42] we'll now show you an example of a
[01:44] strategy that's based on the options
[01:46] expiration week but has one added
[01:48] variable but before we continue let's
[01:51] briefly explain what the options
[01:52] expiration week is all about
[01:54] once a month us options expire on the
[01:57] third Friday of the month because
[01:59] options have a finite life they stop
[02:01] trading at certain dates
[02:03] this chart illustrates the OPEC cycle
[02:05] it's the countdown to each Opex day
[02:08] options expire because they're
[02:10] derivatives and they stop Trading
[02:13] some Traders will lose money some will
[02:15] gain and the last trading days leading
[02:17] up to the third Friday of the month can
[02:18] sometimes be nerve-wracking for those
[02:20] Traders involved this creates
[02:22] opportunities because Traders need to
[02:24] reconsider their positions
[02:26] because of this trading activity and
[02:28] options can have a direct and measurable
[02:30] effect on stock prices especially on the
[02:33] last trading day before expiration
[02:34] something called pen risk
[02:37] now let's show you a specific Opex
[02:39] trading strategy that only takes trades
[02:41] on the Monday open of an options
[02:43] expiration week and exits at the close
[02:45] of the Opex day
[02:47] however we've added one extra simple
[02:49] rule but the strategy is exclusive for
[02:52] our paying members and subscribers the
[02:54] strategies for the ETFs with the ticker
[02:56] codes XLV and xlu which are defensive
[02:59] Healthcare and utility stocks
[03:02] as you can see the performance is good
[03:04] with an upward sloping Equity curve the
[03:07] annual returns are 4.5 percent despite
[03:09] being invested less than 10 percent of
[03:11] the time
[03:12] the average gain per trade is 0.72
[03:15] percent which provides a huge margin of
[03:17] safety for slippage and commissions
[03:19] which are very low for such liquid
[03:20] instruments
[03:22] let's show a third and last options
[03:24] expiration week strategy the performance
[03:26] on the Opex day
[03:28] the trading rules are simple we short
[03:30] spy at the open of any options
[03:32] expiration day and we cover at the close
[03:34] this is a day trade and shows that the
[03:37] Opex day is a pretty consistent losing
[03:39] day for the Bulls the average gain for
[03:42] this short trade is 0.16 percent and it
[03:44] can be improved by adding a variable
[03:46] however that's for another video
[03:48] we've shown you three back-tested
[03:50] trading strategies based on the options
[03:52] expiration week effect that said if you
[03:55] want to trade during the options
[03:56] expiration day or week you might want to
[03:58] get a better understanding of what's
[03:59] happening and why Thus We've provided
[04:02] some frequently asked questions
[04:04] what happens when a call option expires
[04:07] an option resides within two states in
[04:10] the money or out of the money
[04:12] in the out of money scenario the option
[04:14] reaches its expiration with no value
[04:16] resulting in a loss of the initial
[04:18] investment for the owner conversely the
[04:21] seller retains the premium in this
[04:22] situation
[04:24] when the stock price surpasses the
[04:26] strike price prior to the call options
[04:27] expiration the option holder has the
[04:30] choice to either execute the option
[04:31] acquiring the underlying shares or to
[04:34] sell the calls within the market
[04:37] what is penresk pen risk comes from the
[04:40] uncertainty surrounding the potential
[04:42] exercise or assignment of an options
[04:43] contract this occurs specifically when
[04:46] the expiration price of the underlying
[04:48] security aligns closely with the option
[04:50] strike price
[04:51] this phenomenon is termed pinning a
[04:54] stripe
[04:55] for instance if the XYZ stock concludes
[04:57] at 50 upon expiration the strike price
[05:00] of fifty dollars would be considered
[05:02] penned
[05:04] what is quadruple witching day
[05:07] quad witching day is when all derivative
[05:09] contracts expire all options and Futures
[05:11] contracts expire on this particular day
[05:13] this is in March June September and
[05:16] December four times per year
[05:19] is the Opex day a volatile day yes for
[05:23] example this chart shows the volatility
[05:25] of any random day Opex day and quadruple
[05:28] witching day these statistics show that
[05:30] quadruple days are the most volatile
[05:32] followed by Opex days and random days
[05:36] can options be exercised after hours no
[05:39] exercising beyond the official trading
[05:42] hours is not possible nevertheless there
[05:45] might be a possibility if your broker
[05:46] grants such an allowance however
[05:48] exercise caution as trading activity
[05:51] tends to be limited outside these
[05:52] designated hours
[05:55] do options expire at open or close
[05:58] in the U.S it's done at the close not at
[06:00] the open at the expiration day however
[06:03] OTC options might have different
[06:05] expiration times
[06:07] that was all for today and we hope you
