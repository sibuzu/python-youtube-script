[00:00] in this video we show you how you can
[00:02] make money overnight by trading SPY the
[00:05] ETF that tracks S&P
[00:07] 500 we'll show you the trading rules and
[00:10] you can see the results of the overnight
[00:12] trading strategies on the screen so make
[00:14] sure you stay until the
[00:16] end just to make things clear let's
[00:18] briefly explain what an overnight
[00:20] trading strategy is the overnight
[00:23] strategy refers to the historical return
[00:25] in stocks from the close of today's
[00:27] trading session until the open of
[00:29] tomorrow's Trading
[00:30] session for example if S&P 500 closes at
[00:34] 100 today and opens at 101 tomorrow the
[00:37] overnight gain is
[00:39] 1% on the left side you see the S&P
[00:42] 500's accumulated gains from the close
[00:45] until the open since
[00:47] 1993 on the right you see the intraday
[00:50] performance from the open to the close
[00:52] on the same day clearly all the gains
[00:55] have come by owning S&P 500 during the
[00:57] night while you're sleeping this is a
[01:00] nice Edge that makes overnight trading
[01:02] strategies attractive we show you how in
[01:04] this video and let's look at the first
[01:06] overnight trading
[01:08] strategy the trading rules are simple if
[01:10] today is the third lower close in a row
[01:13] you buy the close you sell at the open
[01:15] the next day it's performed well since
[01:19] the Inception in 1993 with small and
[01:21] temporary draw
[01:23] Downs these 661 trades made an average
[01:26] gain of. 13% which translates into
[01:30] annual returns of
[01:32] 2.8% that might not sound like much but
[01:34] keep in mind that you're invested only
[01:36] 8% of the time this is also a strategy
[01:40] that potentially can have some leverage
[01:42] can it be
[01:44] improved yes it gets a lot better if we
[01:46] sell it to close the same day instead of
[01:49] the open you almost double the gains by
[01:52] holding until the close the average gain
[01:54] increases to
[01:56] 0.24% which is five times better than
[01:58] any random day
[02:01] let's go to the third overnight trading
[02:03] strategy this overnight trading strategy
[02:06] uses the RSI indicator to trigger a Buy
[02:09] Signal if the 2-day RSI value drops
[02:12] below 10 we buy S&P 500 at the close and
[02:16] we sell at the open the next
[02:18] day the 741 trade show a consistent
[02:22] performance for over three
[02:24] decades the average gain is 0.14% per
[02:28] trade and the win rate is
[02:30] 62% let's increase the holding time a
[02:33] few hours and sell it the close instead
[02:35] of the
[02:36] open just like in the first trading
[02:38] strategy the performance gets a lot
[02:40] better because of the compounding effect
[02:43] we more than double our Capital compared
[02:45] to the exit at the open even though the
[02:47] average gain increases less than twice
[02:49] to
[02:51] 27% some might argue this is an edge too
[02:54] small to trade but with spy currently
[02:56] trading at over
[02:57] $400 this is more than enough to offset
[03:00] slippage and
[03:01] commissions can the overnight trading
[03:03] strategies be improved or made different
[03:06] if you have any suggestions please
[03:08] comment good luck
[03:14] Trading
