[00:00] are you tired of complicated trading
[00:02] strategies that only lead to confusion
[00:04] and losses well today we might have a
[00:06] solution for you the stairs trading
[00:08] strategy this strategy is based on the
[00:10] simple idea that prices tend to move in
[00:12] a stair-like fashion with each step
[00:14] representing a key level of support or
[00:16] resistance but how can we quantify this
[00:18] and turn it into a profitable trading
[00:20] system let's take a closer look at the
[00:22] trading rules for the stairs trading
[00:24] strategy first the close must be above
[00:27] the 200-day moving average second the
[00:29] close must be below the 25-day moving
[00:32] average if both of these conditions are
[00:34] true then we enter at the close finally
[00:36] when the close crosses above the 25-day
[00:39] moving average we exit at the close now
[00:41] I know what you're thinking how can we
[00:42] trust such a simple trading strategy
[00:44] where's the evidence that it actually
[00:46] works well let me show you this Equity
[00:49] curve represents the performance of the
[00:50] stairs trading strategy on the S P 500
[00:53] as you can see the annual return is 6.1
[00:56] percent while Buy and Hold returns 7.7
[00:59] percent annual really our strategy has
[01:01] substantially lower drawdowns in fact
[01:03] drawdowns are almost consistently lower
[01:05] than 20 percent because the strategy is
[01:08] invested only 23 percent of the time now

[01:12] implement this strategy for yourself the
