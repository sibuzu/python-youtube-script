1. **Purpose of Averaging Down Strategy**:  
   The averaging down strategy aims to reduce the average cost per share by buying additional shares as the stock price decreases, with the goal of maximizing potential profits if the stock recovers.

2. **Example of Averaging Down**:
   - Initially buy 100 shares at $10 each.
   - Price drops to $8; purchase another 100 shares.
   - New average cost per share becomes $9.
   - If the price recovers to $10, a profit is realized.

3. **Two Trading Strategies**:
   - **First Strategy**: Enters when 5-day RSI < 35 and exits when price exceeds yesterday's high (mean reversion).
   - **Second Strategy (Average Down)**: 
     - Initial investment: 50% of capital.
     - Adds remaining 50% when daily RSI drops at least five points below 50, maintaining the same exit trigger.

4. **Backtest Results**:
   - **First Strategy**: Strong performance on S&P 500 since 1993 with positive statistics.
   - **Second Strategy (Average Down)**: Lower overall profits but reduced maximum loss and improved risk-adjusted returns (Profit Factor of 55% vs. 39%).

5. **Preference for Average Down Strategy**:
   - The average down strategy offers better risk-adjusted returns, making it preferable despite lower absolute profits.
