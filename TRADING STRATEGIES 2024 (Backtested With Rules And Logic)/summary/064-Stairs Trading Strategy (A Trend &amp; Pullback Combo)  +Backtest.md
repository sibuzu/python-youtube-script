     - Close must be below the 25-day moving average.
     - Enter at the close when both conditions are met.
   - **Exit Condition**: Exit at the close when the price crosses above the 25-day moving average.

3. **Performance**:
   - Annual return of 6.1% compared to a Buy and Hold strategy's 7.7%.
