The trading strategies discussed focus on Litecoin, a cryptocurrency known for its rapid transaction times. Three distinct approaches are outlined:

1. **Short-Term Trend Following Strategy**: This strategy uses the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) to generate buy and sell signals. If the closing price surpasses the SMA, a long position is taken; if it falls below, a short position is initiated. It has demonstrated superior performance compared to a Buy-and-Hold approach, with an average gain of 8.4% per trade and an annual return of 114%.

2. **Long-Term Trend Following Strategy**: Utilizing 100-day and 250-day SMAs, this strategy signals a long entry when the shorter SMA crosses above the longer one and prompts a sell when the reverse occurs. Despite a smaller sample size (7 trades), it delivered an annual return of 66%, outperforming Buy-and-Hold.

3. **Momentum Strategy**: This approach checks if today's closing price is higher or lower than the price from 25 days prior to decide whether to go long or short. With 129 trades, it achieved an average gain of 9.6% per trade and a 70% annual return, again outpacing Buy-and-Hold.

Each strategy leverages different aspects of market behavior—short-term trends, long-term trends, and momentum—to capitalize on Litecoin's volatility. The video emphasizes the importance of testing and adapting strategies to fit individual trading styles and market conditions.
