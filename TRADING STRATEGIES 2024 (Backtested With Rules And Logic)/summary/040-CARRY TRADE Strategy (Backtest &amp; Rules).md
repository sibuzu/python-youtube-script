The trading strategy discussed is the carry trade, commonly used in Forex. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Mechanism**: Borrow a currency with a low interest rate and convert it into another currency with a higher interest rate. The goal is to profit from the interest rate differential.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Leverage**: Utilized to amplify returns, but it also increases risk.
   - **Currency Pairs**: Typically involves pairs like the Japanese Yen and Dollar, where one has a low interest rate and the other a higher rate.

3. **Risks**:
   - **High Volatility**: Currencies can experience significant fluctuations, leading to potential large losses.
   - **Negative Skewness**: The strategy is prone to tail risks, as highlighted by Nassim Taleb, meaning it's vulnerable to random shocks that can cause substantial losses.

4. **Outcome**: While the strategy may yield many small wins, it carries a high risk of rare, catastrophic losses due to leverage and market volatility.

In summary, the carry trade leverages interest rate differentials but exposes traders to significant risks from currency movements and leverage.
