The trading strategy presented in the video involves using the ISM Manufacturing Index (PMI) as a macroeconomic indicator to guide investments in the S&P 500. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Indicator**: The ISM PMI, which reflects the health of the U.S. manufacturing sector, with readings above 50 indicating expansion and below 50 indicating contraction.

2. **Strategy**:
   - When the PMI reading is above 50 (economic expansion), buy the S&P 500 at the month's opening.
   - Sell at the next month's opening, holding for one month each time.
   
3. **Performance**:
   - The strategy is invested approximately 72% of the time.
   - Annualized return is 7.3%, slightly below the S&P 500's 8.5% but with reduced drawdowns.

4. **Extended Holding Period**:
   - Backtesting shows that holding for longer periods (e.g., 12 months) can enhance returns, with an average gain of 10.99% per trade and higher exposure (86%).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The strategy leverages economic expansion phases indicated by PMI readings above 50 to capture superior returns.
   - Extending holding periods during these expansions can further improve performance.

This approach aims to capitalize on the correlation between manufacturing sector health and market performance, optimizing investment timing based on macroeconomic conditions.
