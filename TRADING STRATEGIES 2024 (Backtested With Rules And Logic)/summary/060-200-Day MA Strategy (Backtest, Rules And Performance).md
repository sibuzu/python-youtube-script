1. **Introduction**  
   - Overview of Paul Tudor Jones and his use of the 200-day moving average.  

2. **What is a Moving Average?**  
   - Definition and explanation of the 200-day moving average (lagging indicator).  
   - Visual representation on a chart (red line as the 200-day MA).  
   - Challenges with whipsaws in sideways price movements.  

3. **Why Paul Tudor Jones Uses the 200-Day Moving Average**  
   - Trend-following strategy: Invest when the S&P 500 is above its 200-day MA, sell when below.  
   - Historical performance since 1960:  
     - Return excluding dividends: 6.75% vs. 7% for buy-and-hold.  
     - Smaller drawdowns (28%) compared to buy-and-hold (56%).  
   - Example of avoiding the 2008 market crash by exiting in late 2007 and re-entering in 2009.  

4. **Using the 200-Day MA as a Filter for Short-Term Trades**  
   - Mean reversion strategy: Buy when RSI <35, sell when >50.  
   - Backtesting results (S&P 500 ETF SPY):  
     - High max drawdown (29%) which could lead to trader exit.  
   - Improved performance by adding the 200-day MA filter:  
     - Reduces volatility and improves win rate.  
     - Higher average gain per trade with fewer trades.  

5. **Performance Comparison**  
   - Without MA filter: High drawdowns and erratic returns.  
   - With MA filter (above): Smoother returns and better metrics.  
   - Below MA filter: More volatile and erratic performance.  

6. **Conclusion**  
   - The 200-day MA as a trend filter simplifies strategies and reduces risk.  
   - Adding the MA filter improves consistency and manageability for traders.  
   - Open invitation to suggest improvements or alternatives.
