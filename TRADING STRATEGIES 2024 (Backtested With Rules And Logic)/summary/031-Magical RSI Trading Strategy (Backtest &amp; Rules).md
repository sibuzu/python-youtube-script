The trading strategy in question employs the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to capitalize on mean reversion in the stock market. Here's a concise summary:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Objective**: To exploit short-term price corrections (mean reversion) by buying low and selling high.

2. **Entry Signal**:
   - **Condition**: Enter when RSI falls below 20, indicating an oversold condition.
   - **Rationale**: Prices are likely to rebound from undervalued levels.

3. **Exit Signals**:
   - **Conditions**: Exit when either of the following is met:
     - RSI rises above 60 (overbought condition).
     - The current close exceeds the previous day's high.
   - **Rationale**: Prices may have reached a peak or are set to trend upward, prompting an exit.

4. **Instrument**: Primarily applied to ETFs like SPY (S&P 500), XLP (Consumer Staples), and XLV (Healthcare), with potential for other assets.

### Performance Metrics:
- **Backtest Results (1993â€“2023)**:
  - **Number of Trades**: 351 trades.
  - **Average Gain per Trade**: ~0.8%.
  - **Annual Return**: ~9.2%, slightly less than buy-and-hold (~9.7%).
  - **Win Rate**: 78% of trades profitable.
  - **Time Invested**: 16% annually, indicating a short holding period.
  - **Risk-Adjusted Return**: 56%, calculated by annual return divided by time invested.
  - **Maximum Drawdown**: 23%.

### Key Considerations:
- **Entry/Exit Levels**: The strategy uses RSI levels of 20 and 60, which are tighter than the commonly cited 30 and 70. This may reduce false signals but could also limit participation in strong trends.
- **Execution**: Exits can occur early if prices trend upward quickly, potentially missing prolonged price movements.
- **Drawdown Risk**: The strategy's maximum drawdown of 23% highlights the importance of risk management.

### Conclusion:
This strategy is effective for short-term traders aiming to capture mean reversion in the market. It balances performance with reduced exposure time, offering a competitive risk-adjusted return. However, it requires careful consideration of entry/exit levels and potential limitations during prolonged trends or slow price corrections.
