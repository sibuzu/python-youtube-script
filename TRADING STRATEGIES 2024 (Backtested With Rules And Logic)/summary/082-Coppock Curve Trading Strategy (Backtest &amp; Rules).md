The Copic Curve Strategy is a momentum indicator-based trading approach developed by economist Copic in the 1960s. It uses a weighted moving average of two rate-of-change values (11 and 14) to identify long-term trends in the stock market, representing early and late uptrend stages.

**Key Features:**
- **Indicator Calculation:** Combines 11-period and 14-period Rate of Change (ROC) indicators.
- **Trading Rules:**
  - Buy when the Copic Curve crosses above its 10-month moving average.
  - Sell when the Copic Curve crosses below its 10-month moving average.

**Performance Highlights:**
- Backtested on the S&P 500 from 1960 to 2023.
- Average annual return of 6.11% vs. S&P's 7.03%.
- Lower maximum drawdown (3.16%) compared to S&P's 52.56%.
- Higher risk-adjusted return (8.29%) than S&P's 7.03%.

**Conclusion:**
The Copic Curve Strategy offers a simple, long-term approach with reduced risk, making it suitable for investors seeking a conservative yet effective strategy.
