### Summary:

#### Themes:
- Financial markets exhibit volatility, with periods of rising and falling prices.
- The concept of "buy the dip" and "sell the rip" is explored, focusing on the latter.

#### Trading Strategy:
- **Original Strategy**: A mean reversion approach using the 3-day RSI indicator. 
  - Long positions are initiated when the RSI drops below 30.
  - Positions are closed when the RSI reaches 70.
- **Improved Strategy**: An enhanced sell signal based on price levels.
  - Sell when the closing price exceeds yesterday's high, indicating overvaluation.

#### Indicators:
- Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the original strategy.
- Price level analysis for the improved sell signal.

#### Backtest Performance:
- **Original Strategy**:
  - 391 trades since 1993.
  - 61% return per trade.
  - Erratic growth with significant drawdowns (up to 35%).
- **Improved Strategy**:
  - Reduced drawdowns, with only two instances exceeding 20%.
  - Annual returns comparable to a buy-and-hold approach.
  - Lower investment time (27% of the time).

#### Market Suitability:
- The strategy is effective for stock markets but less so for commodities and forex, which tend to exhibit more trending behavior.

#### Conclusions:
- The improved sell-the-rip strategy offers better risk-adjusted returns compared to the original mean reversion approach.
- Backtesting is essential to determine the best approach for different markets.
- The strategy requires careful implementation and adaptation based on market conditions.
