The trading strategy discussed is called the "Failed Bounce" strategy. Here's a summary of its key points:

1. **Entry Rules**:
   - Yesterday's IBS (Internal Bar Strength) must be at least 0.6 or higher.
   - Yesterday's low should be lower than the lowest low from the previous five days.

2. **Exit Rule**:
   - Exit when today's close is higher than yesterday's high.

3. **Performance**:
   - The strategy has been tested on stocks since the late 1980s.
   - Out of 204 trades, 77% were winners with an average return of 0.86% per trade.
   - Net profit was 450%, resulting in a 5.8% annualized return.

4. **Risk-Adjusted Return**:
   - The strategy is invested only 8.5% of the time, yielding a risk-adjusted return of 67%.

5. **Applicability**:
   - Works on ETFs based on stocks but not Commodities or bonds.
   - Performed well on QQQ with a 1% average per trade.

6. **Additional Info**:
   - The IBS indicator is emphasized as highly underrated.
   - Strategy codes and backtests are available on the website's resource library.

This strategy appears effective for short-term trading, focusing on identifying potential price movements based on specific internal bar strength criteria.
