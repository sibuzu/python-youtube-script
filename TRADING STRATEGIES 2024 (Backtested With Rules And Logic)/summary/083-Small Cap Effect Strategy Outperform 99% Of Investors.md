The trading strategy discussed revolves around the "small cap effect," which highlights that smaller companies tend to outperform larger ones over the long term. This phenomenon is a key component of the Fama French Three Factor model, which explains stock returns based on size, value, and quality factors.

Key points of the strategy include:

1. **Small Cap Premium**: Historically, small-cap stocks have outperformed large-cap stocks, especially when avoiding the most volatile small-cap issues.
2. **Value Over Growth**: Among small-cap stocks, those with a value orientation (e.g., low P/E ratio) have historically outperformed growth-oriented ones since 1940.
3. **Quality Factor**: Investing in high-quality small-cap stocks, as measured by factors like robustness, has shown significant long-term returns compared to non-quality stocks.

The strategy emphasizes the importance of long-term investing and suggests that even modest initial investments can grow substantially over time due to these factors.
