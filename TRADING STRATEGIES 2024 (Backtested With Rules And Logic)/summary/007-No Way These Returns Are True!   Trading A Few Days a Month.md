3. **Investment Period**:
   - The strategy involves being invested for only seven trading days per month (approximately 33% of the time).

4. **Performance**:
   - The annual return is approximately 7%, which is slightly higher than a buy-and-hold strategy that yields about 6.9%.
   - Drawdowns are significantly smaller, at 27% compared to 56% for a buy-and-hold approach.

5. **Equity Curve**:
   - The equity grows linearly over time with fewer market fluctuations compared to being invested all the time.

6. **Improvements**:
