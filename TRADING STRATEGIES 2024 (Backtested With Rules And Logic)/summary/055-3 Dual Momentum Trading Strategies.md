The video discusses three dual momentum trading strategies, each with different asset pairs and trading rules. Here's a summary:

1. **Stocks vs Bonds (SPY & TLT):**
   - **Trading Rules:** At the end of every month, invest in the ETF (SPY or TLT) that has performed better over the last three months.
   - **Performance:** The strategy has delivered an annualized return of 11.5%, with a maximum drawdown of 30%. It underperformed post-2020 but generally outperforms during market stability.

2. **Stocks vs Gold (SPY & GLD):**
   - **Trading Rules:** Similar to the first strategy, investing in the better-performing asset over three months.
   - **Performance:** This strategy shows promise, especially during market volatility, with a potential for higher returns but also increased risk during drawdown periods.

3. **Stocks vs Cash (SPY & CASH):**
   - **Trading Rules:** Allocate to SPY if it outperforms cash; otherwise, hold cash.
   - **Performance:** This strategy aims to balance growth and safety. Returns are modest compared to others but offers a conservative approach with lower drawdowns.

**Key Points:**
- Dual momentum strategies rely on relative performance between asset pairs.
- They are easy to implement but not guaranteed to yield profits.
- Market timing is avoided, reducing stress and potential mistakes.
- Drawdowns can be significant, especially during market crashes.

The video emphasizes the importance of thorough research and adapting strategies to personal investment goals. It also highlights that while these strategies are simple, they are not without risks and require careful consideration.
