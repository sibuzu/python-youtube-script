The trading strategy described in Chapter Six of Larry Connor's "High Probability Trading" is called the Multiple Days Up and Multiple Days Down Strategy. Here's a summary:

**Objective**: To identify potential buying opportunities when an ETF has experienced significant downward momentum.

**Key Components**:
1. **Entry Signal**: The strategy suggests entering a long position (buying) when an ETF has dropped at least four out of the last five trading days. This is indicated by a specific indicator that swings from low to high, signaling many down days.
   
2. **Supportive Conditions for Entry**:
   - The ETF's price must be above its 200-day moving average (to ensure it's not in a long-term downtrend).
   - The closing price must be below the 5-day moving average (indicating recent weakness).

3. **Entry Timing**: Enter the trade at the close of the day when one of the supportive conditions is met.

4. **Exit Signal**: Exit the trade (sell) when the ETF closes above its 5-day moving average, signaling a potential reversal.

5. **Risk Management**: No stop loss is used in this strategy, which increases risk but aims to capture trends once they have reversed.

**Backtesting Results**:
- Backtests were conducted on 20 different stock market ETFs from 2000 onwards.
- Results varied significantly across individual ETFs.
- When tested as a portfolio with allocations of 20% per signal (holding a maximum of five ETFs at a time), the strategy produced low annual returns due to minimal time spent in the market.
- Testing was also done on SPY and QQQ with 50% equity allocation each, but results remained unimpressive, showing erratic performance.

**Conclusion**: The strategy's results are not particularly impressive, and the creator suggests exploring other strategies available on their website for better outcomes. As always, trading carries risks, and viewers are encouraged to do thorough research before implementing any strategy.

This summary provides a concise overview of the strategy, its mechanics, and the backtesting outcomes mentioned in the video.
