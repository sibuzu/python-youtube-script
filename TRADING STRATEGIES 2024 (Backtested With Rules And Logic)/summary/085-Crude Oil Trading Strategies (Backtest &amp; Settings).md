The trading strategy for crude oil involves four key steps:

1. **Calculate the 25-day Average True Range (ATR)**: The ATR is computed using the daily high minus low prices over a 25-day period.

2. **Trade on Specific Days**: Traders should only execute trades on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

3. **Determine Entry Point**: Enter a short position when today's closing price is lower than yesterday's close by at least one ATR.

4. **Exit the Trade**: Close the trade at the end of the next trading day.

**Performance Analysis**:
