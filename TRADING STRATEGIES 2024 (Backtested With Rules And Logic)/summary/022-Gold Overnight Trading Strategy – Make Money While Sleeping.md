The trading strategy discussed focuses on the gold and gold miners sector, specifically utilizing ETFs such as GDX (gold miners ETF) and GLD (gold price ETF). The key idea revolves around holding positions overnight, from market close to the next open, rather than intraday.

### Key Points:
1. **Overnight Edge**: 
   - The strategy highlights that holding positions overnight in GDX and GLD has historically shown a consistent upward trend, resulting in steady gains.
   - Conversely, buying at the open and selling at the close (intraday) has often resulted in losses.

2. **Historical Consistency**:
   - The equity curve for GDX shows a stable upward slope when held overnight, whereas intraday trading has been less successful.
   - Similarly, GLD's performance from close to next open has outperformed compared to intraday returns, which have been slightly negative on average.

3. **Strategy Enhancement**:
   - While the overnight edge alone may not be significant enough for standalone trading, adding one or two other variables can enhance the strategy.
   - The video mentions a specific "Gold Overnight Strategy" for GLD that incorporates additional variables, resulting in a rising slope and consistent performance over nearly two decades.
