The inverted yield curve trading strategy involves using an inverted yield curve as a signal to make trades. The strategy was backtested twice, with the first buying when the curve inverts and selling 250 days later, yielding an average return of around 7.3% annually, similar to typical annual returns. The second strategy uses mean reversion and the RSI indicator, resulting in an average gain of 2.5% over almost three months per trade. Overall, the research suggests that this strategy is not particularly useful for profitable trading.
