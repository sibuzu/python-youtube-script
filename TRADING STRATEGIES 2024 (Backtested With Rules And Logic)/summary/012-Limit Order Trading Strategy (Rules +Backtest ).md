In this trading strategy video, the focus is on comparing market orders and limit orders to demonstrate how different order types can lead to vastly different outcomes. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Understanding Limit Orders**: A limit order is used to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. It includes a "limit price" which specifies the maximum price to pay for a purchase or the minimum price to accept for a sale.

2. **Backtesting Strategies**:
   - A mean reversion strategy was backtested using a market order on NASDAQ 100. The results showed an average gain of 89% per trade, translating to a compounded annual return of 10.4%. However, the strategy only had an 18% investment utilization rate, meaning the capital was idle for long periods.
   - When the same strategy was modified to use a limit order for the buy signal (buying on weakness), the number of trades significantly decreased by more than half. Despite this, the average gain per trade increased from 89% to 12%. However, the overall compounded annual return dropped to 7.6%, primarily due to missed trading opportunities.

3. **Trade-offs in Trading**: Using a limit order can improve the average gain per trade but may result in fewer trades and lower total returns. This highlights the importance of understanding the trade-offs between different order types and strategy parameters.

4. **Conclusion**: The video emphasizes that while adjusting strategies to use limit orders might enhance individual trade profitability, it can also reduce overall return potential. It encourages viewers to consider their objectives, risk tolerance, and trading goals when deciding on an order type or strategy.

The video concludes by inviting comments for further discussion on possible improvements or variations of the strategy.
