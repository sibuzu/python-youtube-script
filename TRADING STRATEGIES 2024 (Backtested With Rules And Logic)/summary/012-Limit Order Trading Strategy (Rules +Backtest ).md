1. **Themes:**
   - Importance of understanding order types (market vs. limit) for trading outcomes.
   - Backtesting trading strategies to compare performance.

2. **Trading Products/Strategies:**
   - Mean reversion strategy:
     - Buys on weakness, sells on strength.
     - Original implementation used market orders.
     - Modified version uses limit orders for the buy order.

3. **Strategy Details:**
   - Basic mean reversion strategy:
     - Triggers a buy signal when today's open is lower than yesterday's close.
     - Sells at the close of the next trading day.
   - Limit Order Strategy:
     - Same trigger as the basic strategy but uses limit orders for the buy order.
     - Trades are entered the day after the signal.

4. **Backtest Performance:**
   - Market Order Strategy:
     - Average gain per trade: 89%.
     - Annualized return: 10.4%.
     - Investment utilization: 18% (capital idle for long periods).
   - Limit Order Strategy:
     - Number of trades: Significantly fewer, more than half reduction.
     - Average gain per trade: Increased to 112%.
     - Annualized return: Dropped to 7.6%.

5. **Conclusions:**
   - Using limit orders reduces the number of trades but increases the average gain per trade.
   - However, the overall annualized returns are lower due to missed profitable trades.
   - Trading involves trade-offs between frequency of trades and profitability per trade.

6. **Additional Notes:**
   - The strategy's performance can potentially be improved or modified with different parameters or approaches.
   - Suggestions for improvement are encouraged in the comments section.

7. **Key Takeaways:**
   - Understanding order types is crucial for optimizing trading outcomes.
   - Limit orders can lead to higher average gains but may reduce overall profitability due to fewer trades.
   - Mean reversion strategies are optimal for limit orders, as they involve buying on weakness and selling on strength.
