The trading strategy discussed involves using the 350-day moving average (MA) as the primary indicator, with the addition or subtraction of a 7-day Average True Range (ATR) to generate buy and sell signals. Here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Buy Signal**: Initiate a long position when the price breaks above the 350-day MA plus the 7-day ATR.
2. **Sell Signal**: Exit the trade or go short when the price falls below the 350-day MA minus the 7-day ATR.

This strategy aims to capitalize on trends, as it uses a long-term moving average and incorporates volatility (via ATR) to filter signals. However, the creator expresses skepticism about trading sugar due to its complexity and potential risks, both health-related and financial.
