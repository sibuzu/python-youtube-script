The trading strategy presented is based on the inverse relationship between bond markets and stock prices, particularly focusing on U.S. Treasury bonds (TLT) and the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Here's a concise summary:

1. **Key Insight**: When long-term bond prices rise (indicating falling interest rates), stock prices tend to increase because lower interest rates make stocks more attractive compared to fixed-income securities.

2. **Strategy Overview**:
   - **Buy Signal**: Enter the stock market when TLT crosses above its 15-day moving average.
   - **Sell Signal**: Exit the stock market when TLT crosses below its 15-day moving average.

3. **Backtesting Results**:
   - The strategy was tested with different moving averages (ranging from 5 to 100 days).
   - The 15-day moving average showed a consistent performance, with an annual return of approximately 8.85% despite being invested only about 54% of the time.
   - Average gain per trade was 0.51%, and the maximum drawdown was 31%.

4. **Conclusion**: The strategy leverages the inverse relationship between bonds and stocks, timing market entries and exits based on bond price movements to capitalize on periods when stocks are likely to rise.

This approach aims to profit from the correlation between bond markets and stock performance, optimizing investment decisions by tracking bond trends.
