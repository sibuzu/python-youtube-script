The trading strategy discussed in the video revolves around using Hikanashi (also spelled Haikinashi) candles as a trend-following indicator. Here's a concise summary:

1. **What is Hikanashi?**  
   - It’s a charting technique originating from Japan, introduced to the West in the late 1980s.
   - Unlike traditional Japanese candlesticks, Hikanashi uses smoothed average prices (open, high, low, close) to highlight trends and consolidation phases.
   - The open price of each Hikanashi candle is the midpoint of the previous candle's body, eliminating gaps.

2. **Key Features**:
   - It’s a lagging indicator and not based on real-time prices.
   - Useful for smoothing out price noise and identifying directional trends.
   - Best suited for long time frames (e.g., monthly bars).

3. **Trading Strategy**:
   - **Entry Signal**: Buy when the close of the Hikanashi candle crosses above its open.
   - **Exit Signal**: Sell when the close crosses below its open.
   - Tested on the S&P 500 index using monthly data from 1960 to present.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Annual return: ~4.77% (vs. Buy & Hold at ~7%).
   - Lower maximum drawdown (~30%) compared to Buy & Hold (~53%), making it less risky.

5. **Recommendations**:
   - Backtest any strategy before risking real money.
   - Combine with other indicators for enhanced results.

In conclusion, Hikanashi can be a valuable tool for trend-following strategies, particularly on longer time frames, but it’s essential to backtest and use it alongside other techniques for optimal performance.
