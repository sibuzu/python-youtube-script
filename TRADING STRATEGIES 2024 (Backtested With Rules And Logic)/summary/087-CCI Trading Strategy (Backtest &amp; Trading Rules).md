The trading strategy discussed involves using the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) indicator to identify potential trend reversals and execute trades on the S&P 500. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Indicator**: CCI is used to measure price levels relative to historical averages, helping identify oversold or overbought conditions.

2. **Setup**:
   - **Lookback Period**: A medium period of 9 days was optimized for the S&P 500.
   - **Entry Signal**: Buy when CCI drops below -90.
   - **Exit Signal**: Sell when the closing price exceeds yesterday's high.

3. **Performance**:
   - **Equity Growth**: Starting with $100,000 in 1993, the strategy grew to over $1 million.
   - **Number of Trades**: 464 trades were executed.
   - **Average Profit per Trade**: $253.
   - **Win Rate**: 47% success rate, meaning nearly half of the trades lost money.
   - **Risk-to-Reward Ratio**: The strategy offers a favorable ratio of 1.8:1.

4. **Conclusion**: While the strategy has strong equity growth and a good risk-reward ratio, its low win rate and high number of losing trades make it challenging in terms of overall profitability.
