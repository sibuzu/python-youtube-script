The trading strategy summarized is to avoid investing in stocks with low market value and high volatility, as these have historically underperformed since President John F. Kennedy took office. Specifically, the strategy highlights steering clear of penny stocks and small-cap stocks with uncertain business models, which have often yielded negative returns. The suggestion is to focus on excluding such volatile and risky investments to potentially improve overall portfolio performance, aligning with Nassim Taleb's idea that avoiding the bad can be as valuable as seeking the good.
