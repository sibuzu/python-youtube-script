The trading strategy presented combines elements of superstition and technical analysis. Here's a concise summary:

**Strategy Overview:**
- **Objective:** To capitalize on market behavior around Friday the 13th and identify trends for potential long positions.

**Rule 1 (Friday the 13th):**
- If the date is a Friday the 13th, evaluate the S&P 500's performance the previous day.
- **Action:**
  - Go LONG if the prior day's closing price was higher than the opening price.
  - Stay out of the market if the prior day ended lower.

**Rule 2 (Trend Following):**
- If Rule 1 is not applicable, assess whether the S&P 500 has been in an uptrend over the last three consecutive weeks.
- **Action:**
  - Enter a LONG position on Fridays if an uptrend is confirmed.
  - Do nothing otherwise.

**Rationale:**
- Friday the 13th isn't inherently unlucky for the market, with historical data showing similar performance to other Fridays. The strategy leverages prior day's price action on these dates.
- Trend analysis aims to capture sustained upward movements over three weeks, providing a longer-term perspective.

This strategy blends superstition (testing Friday the 13th) with technical analysis (trend following) to inform trading decisions.
