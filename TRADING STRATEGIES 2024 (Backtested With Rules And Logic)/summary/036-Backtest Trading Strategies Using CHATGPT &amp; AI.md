The trading strategy discussed involves utilizing Chat GPT, an AI developed by OpenAI, to assist in generating and backtesting trading ideas. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Objective**: Explore whether Chat GPT can serve as a tool to gain an edge in trading by generating and backtesting strategies.

2. **Training the AI**: 
   - The user needs to guide Chat GPT on what they want it for, i.e., trading.
   - Provide basic trading ideas to prompt the AI's creativity.

3. **Backtesting Process**:
   - A Bollinger Band Mean Reversion strategy was chosen for backtesting.
   - Parameters set: 20-period Bollinger Bands with a deviation factor of 2.
   - The strategy involves buying when the price closes below the lower band and selling when it closes above the upper band.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Chat GPT was used to write Python code for backtesting using libraries like pandas, numpy, yfinance, and matplotlib.
   - The generated code was run without modifications.

5. **Results**:
   - The strategy showed an annual return of 3.2% with 326 trades.
   - The equity curve appeared reasonable, indicating potential as a starting point for further development.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Chat GPT is not a trading platform or financial advisor but can be a valuable tool for brainstorming ideas and generating backtests.
   - AI tools like Chat GPT are expected to become integral parts of quantitative models, revolutionizing the trading landscape.

The video emphasizes that while Chat GPT may not provide a "killer strategy," it offers a useful starting point for traders to build their own models.
