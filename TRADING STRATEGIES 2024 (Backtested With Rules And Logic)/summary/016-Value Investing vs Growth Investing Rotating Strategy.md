The trading strategy presented in the video focuses on rotating investments between value and growth stocks based on their relative performance. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Value vs. Growth Stocks**:
   - **Value Investing**: Involves buying undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals, expecting the market to recognize their true worth over time. These stocks are generally more stable and less volatile.
   - **Growth Investing**: Focuses on stocks expected to grow at a faster rate than the overall market. These stocks often have higher valuations due to their growth potential but can be more volatile.

2. **Historical Performance**:
   - Value stocks have historically outperformed growth stocks over the long term, though growth stocks can outperform in the short term, especially during periods of economic growth or rising interest rates (e.g., post-2008 financial crisis).

3. **Rotation Strategy**:
   - The strategy involves using ETFs that track value and growth stocks: IUSV (value) and IUSG (growth).
   - A momentum ratio is calculated by dividing the price of IUSG by IUSV.
   - 10-day and 40-day moving averages are used to determine short-term momentum trends.

4. **Implementation**:
   - When value stocks outperform growth stocks, investors sell growth ETFs (IUSG) and buy value ETFs (IUSV).
   - Conversely, when growth stocks outperform, investors sell value ETFs and buy growth ETFs.
   - This rotation aims to capitalize on the relative strength of each asset class.

5. **Performance**:
   - The strategy claims an annual return of 9%, outperforming both value-only (7.4%) and growth-only investments.
   - It also reduces price variation, thereby lowering risk compared to holding individual stocks.

6. **Criticism**:
   - Critics argue that market timing is difficult and advocate for a "Buy and Hold" approach with diversification instead.

This strategy leverages the relative performance of value and growth ETFs to dynamically adjust holdings, aiming to capture superior returns by rotating based on momentum signals.
