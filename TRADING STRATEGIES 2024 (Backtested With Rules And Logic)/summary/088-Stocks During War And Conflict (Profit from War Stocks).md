The trading strategy discussed in the video suggests that historically, stock markets have not experienced significant declines during times of war, with the maximum loss being around 20% after events like Pearl Harbor. The reasoning behind this is multifaceted:

1. **Government Spending and Economic Activity**: Wars can stimulate government spending, which may boost economic activity.
2. **Anticipation by Markets**: Conflicts are often anticipated and priced into markets before they begin, reducing surprise and panic.
3. **Volatility Decrease**: Interestingly, market volatility tends to decrease during conflicts, contrary to intuition.

The strategy advises investors to consider the following:

- If your local market is not directly involved in the conflict, it might be prudent to "buy on the sound of cannons" (i.e., invest when conflict begins) and "sell on the sound of trumpets" (i.e., sell as peace negotiations or resolutions begin).

This approach is a general rule, and investors should consider their individual circumstances and consult with financial advisors. For more detailed strategies, the video recommends visiting Quantified Strategies' website or YouTube channel.
