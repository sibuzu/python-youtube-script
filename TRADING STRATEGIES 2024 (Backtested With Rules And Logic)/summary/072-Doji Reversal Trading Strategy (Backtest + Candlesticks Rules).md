- **Exit Rules**:
  - Initial strategy: Sell after a specific number of trading days (e.g., 5 days).
  - Improved exit criteria:
    - Sell when the closing price is higher than the previous day's high, exploiting mean reversion.
    - Incorporate an RSI filter: Buy only when the 5-day RSI is below 50, indicating oversold conditions.

#### 3. Backtest Performance

  - Equity curve shows a positive trend, though not linear.

#### 4. Conclusions
