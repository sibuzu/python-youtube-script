The trading strategy discussed is centered around **Trend Following**, which aims to capture extended market trends without predicting specific price points. Here's a concise summary:

### Core Concept of Trend Following:
- Focuses on riding ongoing market trends, whether up or down.
- Avoids trying to predict market tops or bottoms.
- Utilizes simple rules based on moving averages and other indicators to generate buy/sell signals.

### Advantages of Trend Following:

- **Risk-Adjusted Returns:** Lower drawdowns compared to Buy & Hold, offering better risk-reward ratios.

### Disadvantages:
- **Whipsawing:** Frequent false signals can lead to losses during market corrections.
- **Low Win Rate:** Many trades may result in losses, relying on a few profitable ones for gains.
- **Requires Discipline:** Must avoid cutting winners short and stick to the rules despite losing streaks.

### Conclusion:
Trend Following strategies offer a viable alternative to Buy & Hold, particularly appealing to those who prefer systematic, non-predictive approaches. However, they demand patience and discipline due to their reliance on big gains offsetting numerous smaller losses.
