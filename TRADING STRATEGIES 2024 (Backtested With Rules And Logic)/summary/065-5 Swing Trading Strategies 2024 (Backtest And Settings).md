The video presents five back-tested and proven swing trading strategies, each with distinct rules and performance metrics. Here's a concise summary:

1. **First Strategy**: Buys when the daily range is lower than the previous six days and closes above the 200-day moving average. Exits on a close higher than the prior dayâ€™s high. It generated an annual return of 14.1%, with equity growing from $100k to $5.3M, and only three losing years (2011, 2015, 2018).

2. **Second Strategy**: Involves buying when the high is a new 10-day peak and IBS <0.15. The equity curve shows consistent growth with minimal drawdown.

3. **Third Strategy**: Utilizes range and moving average filters to enter trades, achieving an annual return of 3.24% with low drawdown.

4. **Fourth Strategy**: Combines multiple indicators for entry but focuses on the same exit signal, resulting in a moderate number of trades and consistent returns.

5. **Fifth Strategy**: Incorporates IBS and high filters to enter trades, yielding an average gain per trade of 0.6% with minimal investment time.

When combined, all five strategies, allocated 100% to one position at a time, produced impressive results: $100k growing to $5.3M, only three losing years, and outperforming traditional buy-and-hold investing, especially in volatile markets like 2008 and 2022.
