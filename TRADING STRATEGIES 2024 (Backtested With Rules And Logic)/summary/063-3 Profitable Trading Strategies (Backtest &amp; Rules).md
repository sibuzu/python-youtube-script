### Summary of the Article: Three Profitable Trading Strategies

#### Themes:
- **Mean Reversion vs. Trend Following**: The article explores both mean reversion and trend following strategies, as well as a combination of the two.
- **Diversification in Trading**: Emphasizes the importance of using multiple strategies that trade different markets, time frames, and market directions to enhance returns and reduce drawdowns.

#### Trading Products:
- **SPY ETF (S&P 500)**: Used for backtesting the rubber band strategy and the combined strategy.
- **QQQ ETF (NASDAQ 100)**: Used for backtesting the combined strategy.

#### Indicators:
- **Moving Averages**: 
  - 50-day Simple Moving Average (used in the Golden Cross strategy).
  - 200-day Simple or Exponential Moving Average (used to determine market trends and as a filter in the combined strategy).
- **RSI**: Mentioned in passing for future videos but not detailed in this article.

#### Strategy Details:
1. **Rubber Band Strategy**:
   - Focuses on mean reversion.
   - Involves buying oversold assets and selling overbought assets.
   - Example: Buying SPY when it is oversold (e.g., RSI < 30) and selling when it becomes overbought (e.g., RSI > 70).

2. **Golden Cross Strategy**:
   - Focuses on trend following.
   - Involves buying when the price crosses above the 50-day moving average and selling when it crosses below.

3. **Combined Strategy**:
   - Combines mean reversion (rubber band strategy) with trend following (Golden Cross strategy).
   - Adds a filter using the 200-day moving average to avoid entering trades in downtrending markets.
   - Example: Only enter rubber band signals when the price is above its 200-day moving average.

#### Backtest Performance:
- **Rubber Band Strategy**:
  - SPY: 12.5% annualized returns with short holding periods and modest drawdowns.
  - QQQ: 13.6% annualized returns with similar performance characteristics.

- **Golden Cross Strategy**:
  - SPY: 9.8% annualized returns with longer holding periods and larger drawdowns.
  - QQQ: Not explicitly mentioned but assumed to have similar performance.

- **Combined Strategy**:
  - SPY: 12.5% annualized returns, combining the benefits of both strategies while reducing drawdowns.
  - QQQ: 13.6% annualized returns, with even better performance due to the nature of growth stocks in NASDAQ.

#### Conclusions:
- **No Perfect Strategy**: Emphasizes that no single strategy is optimal and suggests using a diversified approach.
- **Importance of Diversification**: Trading multiple strategies across different markets, time frames, and market directions can enhance returns without significantly increasing drawdowns.
- **Finite Life of Strategies**: Recognizes that trading strategies have a finite lifespan due to market adaptability and changing conditions.

#### FAQ:

   - Focus on backtesting with clear trading rules, followed by incubation or demo testing for at least 12 months.
   
2. **Most Profitable Trading Strategy**:
   - There is no single best strategy; using multiple complementary strategies is more effective.

3. **How Long a Strategy Can Last**:
   - Strategies typically have a finite lifespan, so diversification across different markets and time frames is crucial.
