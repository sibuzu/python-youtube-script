### 1. **Main Points Organized by Sections**

#### **Themes**
- The performance of long-only stock strategies during bear markets compared to bull markets.
- The concept of mean reversion trading strategies.
- The importance of market trends and volatility in trading.

#### **Trading Products**
- NASDAQ 100 Index (ETF with ticker code QQQ).

#### **Indicators**
- 200-day Moving Average (to define bull vs bear markets).
- 2-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) to signal entry points.
- Close prices for exit signals.

#### **Strategy Details**
- **Long Strategy:**
  - Enter long when the 2-day RSI drops below 10.
  - Exit long on a day with strength, i.e., when the close ends higher than yesterdayâ€™s high.
  - Filter trades to occur only when QQQ is above its 200-day moving average (bull market).
- **Short Strategy:**
  - Uses two 100-day averages as a trend filter.
  - Filtered for bear markets (when QQQ is below its 200-day moving average).

#### **Backtest Performance**
- **Long Strategy:**
  - Average gain per trade during bull markets: Not explicitly mentioned but implied to be good.
  - Average gain per trade during bear markets: 1.3%.
- **Short Strategy:**
  - Performance shown during bear markets with significant volatility (twice as high as in bull markets).

#### **Conclusions**
- Long-only strategies can perform better during bear markets than bull markets.
- Bear markets offer opportunities for both long and short strategies due to increased inefficiency and volatility.
- Counterintuitive but effective: making money during uncertain times when problems are solved.

#### **Additional Notes**
- Volatility in bear markets is higher, leading to trading inefficiencies that can be exploited.
- The 200-day moving average serves as a simple yet effective trend indicator.
