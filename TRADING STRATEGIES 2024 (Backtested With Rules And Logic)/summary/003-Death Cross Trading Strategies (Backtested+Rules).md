- **Definition and Calculation**:
  - A death cross involves two moving averages: one short (e.g., 50-day) and one long (e.g., 200-day).
  - It is identified when the short MA crosses below the long MA.

  - Lagging indicator.
  - Typically uses daily bars with 50-day and 200-day moving averages.

  - Backtested from 1960, showing a flat equity curve.
  - Investors were only invested 30% of the time despite stocks compounding at 10% annually.
