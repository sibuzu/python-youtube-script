[00:00] today we explain and show you eight
[00:02] quantitative trading strategies and
[00:04] examples complete with trading rules and
[00:06] back tests without further Ado we go
[00:09] straight at it and show you the first
[00:11] strategy
[00:12] the first quantitative strategy is
[00:14] called the Russell rebalancing strategy
[00:17] the strategy buys Russell 2000 at the
[00:19] first trading day after 23rd of June and
[00:22] sells it on the first trading day of
[00:24] July
[00:25] this simple annual seasonal Traders
[00:27] returned 1.3 percent per trade and been
[00:30] very consistent as you can see from the
[00:32] equity curve
[00:34] by the way if you want more videos like
[00:36] this and help our Channel grow please
[00:38] give this video a like and consider
[00:40] subscribing to our Channel
[00:42] now let's go straight to the second
[00:43] quantitative trading strategy which
[00:46] we've named the rubber band strategy
[00:48] this is a mean reversion strategy and
[00:51] the trading rules are a bit more complex
[00:52] than the first one but it performs well
[00:55] on S P 500 as you can see from the chart
[00:58] the average gain per trade is 0.66
[01:01] percent which equals an annual return of
[01:03] 6.4 percent despite being invested only
[01:06] 14 percent of the time
[01:08] the third data-driven strategy is called
[01:11] the money flow index strategy the mfi
[01:14] resembles RSI but incorporates volume
[01:16] and signals overbought and oversold
[01:19] conditions
[01:20] the trading rules are simple we buy on
[01:22] weakness and sell on strength and use a
[01:25] time stop of 10 days in other words a
[01:28] classical mean reversion strategy
[01:30] back tested on QQQ which tracks NASDAQ
[01:33] 100 it performs well
[01:35] the strategy is invested only 34 of the
[01:38] time but manage annual returns of 11.1
[01:41] percent and an average gain per trade of
[01:44] 0.46 percent
[01:45] not too bad for such simple trading
[01:47] rules
[01:48] let's now show a slightly more
[01:50] complicated quad strategy for stocks
[01:53] gold and bonds and their relevant ETF
[01:55] ticker codes of spy GLD and TLT
[02:00] it's based on trading rules made by Meb
[02:02] Faber in 2015 and it's a monthly
[02:05] rotation and momentum strategy where we
[02:07] buy the relevant ETF if the three-month
[02:09] moving average is above the 10-month
[02:11] average
[02:12] if it's not we stay away for one month
[02:14] until we rinse and repeat the process
[02:16] we invest a hundred percent of the
[02:18] equity all the time and divide each
[02:20] position on the number of positions we
[02:22] have
[02:22] we make .77 per trade and the annual
[02:26] returns are good at 12 percent however
[02:28] since it was published in 2015 it's not
[02:31] performed nearly as good as in the past
[02:34] the strategy has considerable lower
[02:36] drawdowns compared to stocks and the
[02:38] correlation to the stock market is low
[02:40] for example in 2008 it was up a lot
[02:43] while stocks went South
[02:45] our fifth quantitative trading strategy
[02:47] uses weekly bars and we use the most
[02:50] famous indicator there is the relative
[02:52] strength index abbreviated RSI
[02:55] the logic of RSI is simple buy oversold
[02:59] assets and sell overbought assets but it
[03:01] works well for mean reversion assets
[03:03] like stocks
[03:04] we backtest on consumer staples and the
[03:07] ETF with the ticker code xlp and we buy
[03:10] when the RSI is below 15 and sell when
[03:13] returns above 20.
[03:15] it's simple but it's worked nicely the
[03:18] annual returns are 4.2 percent but it's
[03:20] invested only 11 percent of the time and
[03:22] we can argue the risk-adjusted return is
[03:25] 37 percent
[03:26] we calculate risk adjusted return by
[03:28] dividing the annual return of 4.2
[03:31] percent by 0.11 which is the time spent
[03:34] invested
[03:35] let's now present our favorite
[03:37] quantitative trading strategy it's based
[03:39] on a very strong seasonal effect in the
[03:41] stock market but it also works for other
[03:43] assets
[03:44] it's called the turn of the month
[03:46] strategy and buy on the fifth flash
[03:48] trading day of the month and sells on
[03:50] the third trading day of the new month
[03:53] since 1960 it's captured all the gains
[03:55] in S P 500 annual returns are seven
[03:58] percent despite being invested only 33
[04:01] percent of the time
[04:03] for comparison this is the equity curve
[04:05] when you're invested in all other
[04:07] trading days of the month
[04:09] the turn of the month is a spectacular
[04:11] seasonality let's present you a
[04:13] quantitative volatility strategy however
[04:16] this one is a premium strategy meant for
[04:18] our paying members and thus we don't
[04:20] provide you these specific trading rules
[04:23] strategy works on a wide range of assets
[04:25] but best for stocks our favorite trading
[04:28] asset
[04:29] the equity for S P 500 shows a steady
[04:31] performance all the way back to 1993. it
[04:35] doesn't trade that often and spends only
[04:37] eight percent of the time invested in
[04:39] the market
[04:40] despite this the annual returns are 6.1
[04:42] percent and drawdowns are relatively
[04:44] modest and short-lived
[04:46] for Nasdaq 100 and QQQ the performance
[04:49] is even better with 11.6 annual returns
[04:52] which is significantly better than Buy
[04:54] and Hold at 8.6 percent
[04:57] let's now show you the eighth and last
[04:59] strategy this one also a seasonal
[05:01] strategy but trades long-term treasury
[05:04] bonds we backtested the ETF with the
[05:06] ticker code TLT and we got the following
[05:09] performance
[05:10] the performance and statistics are very
[05:12] good at 9.8 percent annual returns it's
[05:15] more than double the buy and holds 4.5
[05:17] percent again the strategies invested
[05:20] only 56 percent of the time and hence
[05:22] the performance is even more impressive
[05:25] unfortunately this one is also a member
[05:28] strategy and thus we won't reveal the
[05:30] trading rules
[05:31] we've now given you eight quantitative
[05:33] strategy examples when you quantify
[05:35] trading rules just like we did in this
[05:37] video it gives you power because you can
[05:39] trade many automated trading systems
[05:41] from your computer at home
[05:43] automation is power because it enables
[05:45] you to trade in almost unlimited amount
[05:48] of strategies
[05:49] this is how Jim Simons and The Medallion
[05:51] fund made 66 annually for 30 years
[05:55] frequently we receive emails from
[05:57] readers asking about quantitative
[05:58] trading algorithmic trading in our
[06:00] systematic trading approach we'll
[06:03] briefly answer some of them
[06:05] can you do quantitative trading on your
[06:06] own and if so how do you start
[06:08] quantitative trading indeed you can do
[06:11] it on your own it's not difficult first
[06:13] you need to be willing to learn second
[06:15] you need to learn how to back test
[06:17] strategies it's not rocket science this
[06:19] is something everyone can do once you
[06:21] can back test automation is just a minor
[06:24] step is quat trading difficult no we
[06:28] believe these systematic trading
[06:29] approach in this video shows you that
[06:31] it's doable for most Traders and
[06:33] investors
[06:34] how profitable is Quant Trading
[06:37] that depends on a lot of factors however
[06:39] it doesn't need to be complicated to be
[06:41] profitable probably the opposite is true
[06:44] the less complicated the more profitable
[06:46] in the long run but you need a
[06:49] systematic mindset and believe in the
[06:51] law of large numbers for the odds to pan
[06:53] out
[06:54] as an example of a systematic trading
[06:56] technique just look at the performance
[06:58] of two of the strategy bundles we sell
[07:00] on our website
[07:01] this is the three long strategies and
[07:04] three short strategies is one portfolio
[07:06] of strategies
[07:07] annual return is 25 since
[07:10] 2016 since 2010 with small and short
[07:14] drawdowns
[07:16] let's summarize the video by briefly
[07:18] discussing the pros and cons of
[07:20] quantitative trading the pros and
[07:22] advantages are in our opinion obvious
[07:24] let's list them one by one
[07:27] buying and selling is done by your
[07:29] computer no need to stare at the screen
[07:31] all day
[07:32] two you can automate and focus on
[07:34] developing new strategies all the time
[07:37] three you can trade many strategies for
[07:40] the time spent trading is the same if
[07:42] you trade 1 or 50 strategies
[07:45] five you keep a layer between you and
[07:47] the actual trading and this might make
[07:49] you less liable to poor trading
[07:51] decisions cognitive mistakes and
[07:53] overriding the signals
[07:55] unfortunately not all is Rosie there are
[07:58] some cons and disadvantages
[08:00] one you need to learn some coding two
[08:03] you need experience to find systems and
[08:05] strategies three it requires work to
[08:07] find new strategies and systems
