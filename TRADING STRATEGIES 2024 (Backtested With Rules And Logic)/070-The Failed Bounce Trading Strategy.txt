[00:00] today we are going to show you a
[00:01] strategy that we published on our
[00:03] website eight years ago it's called the
[00:05] failed bounce trading strategy why is it
[00:08] called the failed bounce we don't know
[00:10] no matter the name let's go to the
[00:12] trading rules because trading is all
[00:13] about making good strategies to make
[00:15] some money yesterday's IBS internal bar
[00:18] strength was at least 0.6 or higher
[00:20] yesterday's low was lower than the
[00:22] lowest low during the five days before
[00:24] today's close is lower than yesterday's
[00:26] close exit when the close is higher than
[00:28] yesterday's high in case you're
[00:30] wondering what the IBS is we have
[00:31] covered that one in a separate video in
[00:34] our opinion the IBS is the most
[00:36] underrated indicator out there make sure
[00:38] you do not miss that video let's look at
[00:40] some trade examples here we see three
[00:42] trades two winners and one loser we buy
[00:45] on short-term pullbacks and sell-on
[00:47] strength this has worked well on stocks
[00:49] since the late 1980s the trading
[00:51] statistics are good the 204 trades
[00:53] returned an average of 0.86 percent per
[00:56] trade and 77 percent turned out to be
[00:59] winners net profit is 450 and the annual
[01:03] return is 5.8 percent we get these solid
[01:06] results despite being invested only 8.5
[01:08] percent of the time that equals a
[01:10] risk-adjusted return of 67 does the
[01:14] strategy work on other ETFs or Futures
[01:16] it does but it works only on ETFs based
[01:19] on stocks not Commodities or bonds the
[01:21] equity curve on the left is Pepsi Cola
[01:23] since 1976 and on the right we have xlp
[01:26] which tracks consumer staples and the
[01:28] best is QQQ which has a one percent
[01:30] average per trade if you want to know
[01:32] the code we use for this strategy you
[01:34] can find that on our website where we
[01:35] have hundreds of strategies for all
[01:37] asset classes all of them are coded and
