[00:01] the 9 30 training strategy is a trend
[00:04] following strategy that is based on two
[00:06] moving averages a nine period
[00:09] exponential moving average and a 30
[00:11] period weighted moving average the nine
[00:14] period EMA shows the short-term Trend
[00:17] while the 30 period WMA shows the longer
[00:21] term trend
[00:22] this is an example of how the two
[00:25] averages look like on the chart
[00:28] let's practice the strategy on S P 500
[00:31] the trading rules of the first back test
[00:34] are like this when the short Nine Dead
[00:37] EMA crosses above the slow 30-day WMA we
[00:41] buy at the close
[00:43] when the short nine-day EMA crosses
[00:46] below the slow 30-day WMA we sell at the
[00:50] close
[00:50] the equity curve looks like this
[00:54] the average gain is 0.85 percent per
[00:58] trade but it fails to be at Buy and Hold
[01:01] 4.6 versus 9.2 percent
[01:04] let's make a second back test with 100
[01:07] quantifiable trading rules
[01:10] the bullish trend is defined when the
[01:12] nine-day EMA is above the 30-day WMA
[01:16] with the latter sloping upward
[01:19] if this is the case we buy at a close
[01:21] and hold until the close of the next
[01:23] trading Day we sell when one of the two
[01:26] parameters above is false
[01:29] the result is more or less in line with
[01:31] back test number one four point five
[01:34] percent annual Returns versus 9.2
[01:38] percent for Buy and Hold
[01:40] the time spent in the market is only 60
[01:42] so we might argue the risk adjusted
[01:45] return is not so bad
[01:47] anyway you can read more about the
