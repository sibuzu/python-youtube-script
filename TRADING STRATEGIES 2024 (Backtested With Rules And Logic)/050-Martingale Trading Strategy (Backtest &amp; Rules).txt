[00:00] hey everyone welcome to Quantified
[00:02] strategies today we're going to be
[00:04] talking about the Martingale trading
[00:06] strategy this is a popular strategy but
[00:08] it's also very risky so before you use
[00:11] it we want to make sure you understand
[00:12] how it works and the risks involved
[00:15] in this video we make a back-tested
[00:18] example to show you how it works and why
[00:20] it's not a good idea
[00:22] the Martingale trading strategy is a
[00:24] gambling strategy that involves doubling
[00:26] your bed size after each loss the idea
[00:29] is that if you keep doubling your bed
[00:31] size you're eventually bound to win a
[00:33] trade and recoup all your losses
[00:36] let's say you start with a bed size of a
[00:38] hundred dollars if you lose that trade
[00:40] you double your bed size to 200 for the
[00:43] next trade if you lose that trade too
[00:45] you double your bet size again to 400
[00:47] and so on
[00:49] theoretically this strategy will work if
[00:51] the probability of winning a trade is 50
[00:53] percent
[00:54] that means that you're just as likely to
[00:57] win as you are to lose so if you keep
[00:59] doubling your bed size you're eventually
[01:01] bound to win a trade and recoup all your
[01:03] losses
[01:04] however there are a few problems with
[01:06] this strategy in the financial markets
[01:08] first the probability of winning a trade
[01:10] is rarely fifty percent if you trade
[01:12] long enough you'll have many losers in a
[01:14] row even with the best strategies which
[01:16] can wipe out your account
[01:18] second even if you do win a trade you
[01:20] may not recoup all of your losses this
[01:23] is because you'll need to win a trade
[01:25] that's twice as big as your biggest loss
[01:27] in order to break even
[01:29] so as the Martingale trading strategy a
[01:31] good idea
[01:32] let's make a practical example and back
[01:35] test the trading strategy on s p 500. we
[01:38] make the following trading rules to
[01:40] create a base test to compare against
[01:43] the strategy performs well and returns
[01:45] 8.7 percent annually despite being
[01:47] invested a small fraction of the time
[01:50] now let's assume you want to change the
[01:52] strategy so that you employ only 33
[01:55] percent of your Equity when the 4-day
[01:57] RSI crosses below 30 and you add the
[02:00] rest 66 percent when it crosses below
[02:02] 20.
[02:03] this is Martingale in practice
[02:06] at least for one doubling
[02:08] unfortunately it gets worse as the chart
[02:11] indicates compared to the original
[02:12] strategy the total gain is reduced see
[02:15] the right chart because less capital is
[02:18] put to use they're on the sidelines
[02:19] waiting to get martingaled and a few
[02:22] rare losers make losses bigger you get
[02:26] the worst of both
[02:27] so to sum up the Martingale strategy is
[02:30] a bad idea for Traders it's a very risky
[02:33] strategy that can easily wipe out your
[02:34] account and you need to have capital on
[02:37] the sidelines waiting
[02:38] you better look for another approach to
[02:40] make money Martingale was meant for
[02:42] gambling and that's where it belongs
