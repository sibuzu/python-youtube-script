[00:11] can take advantage of recent price
[00:13] trends in Bitcoin by analyzing the level
[00:16] of price momentum in the market but
[00:18] before we dive into the specifics let's
[00:20] start with the basics what is momentum
[00:23] Trading
[00:24] momentum trading involves buying and
[00:26] selling securities based on the strength
[00:28] of recent price trends essentially we're
[00:31] trying to identify upward or downward
[00:33] Trends in the market and then take
[00:35] positions accordingly so how does
[00:37] momentum trading work in the Bitcoin
[00:39] market we've back tested a price action
[00:41] momentum strategy in Bitcoin and the
[00:44] trading rules are simple when the close
[00:46] crosses above the 25-day high of the
[00:48] close we go long at the close when the
[00:51] close crosses below the 25-day high of
[00:54] the close we sell at the close
[00:56] as you can see on the screen we have a
[00:59] performance chart from our backtest the
[01:01] chart shows that we have had a total of
[01:03] 179 traits with an average gain per
[01:06] trade of 2.35 percent this means that
[01:09] traders who followed our strategy and
[01:11] took advantage of recent price trends
[01:13] could potentially earn profits but
[01:16] that's not all the compound annual
[01:18] growth rate is a remarkable 55.7 percent
[01:21] and the max drawdown is just 23 percent
[01:24] these impressive statistics suggest that
[01:26] momentum trading can be a profitable
[01:28] strategy for Bitcoin to sum up momentum
[01:32] trading can be an effective way to take
[01:34] advantage of recent price trends in
[01:36] Bitcoin by analyzing the level of price
[01:38] momentum in the market and following the
