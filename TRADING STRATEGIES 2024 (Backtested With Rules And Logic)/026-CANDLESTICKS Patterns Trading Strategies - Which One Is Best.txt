[00:12] can please stick to the end and we'll
[00:14] show you how profitable they are because
[00:16] all Candlestick analysis is based on
[00:18] anecdotal evidence and random charts
[00:20] that normally exclude the bad trades we
[00:22] decided to quantify all the Candlestick
[00:25] patterns make a back test and rank the
[00:27] patterns the results are summarized in a

[00:40] let's look at the performance of s p 500
[00:43] by using the 10 best Candlestick
[00:44] patterns that had at least 50 trades
[00:46] over the last 30 years we rank the
[00:49] patterns based on the profit factor a
[00:51] metric that measures performance and we
[00:53] got the following Equity curve as you
[00:55] can see it's pretty impressive results

[01:25] can safely say that the candlesticks
[01:27] have provided uncorrelated returns
[01:29] compared to buy and hold for example
