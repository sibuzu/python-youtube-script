[00:00] bare market trading strategy in this
[00:03] video we'll show you a bare Market
[00:05] trading strategy and explain why you
[00:07] should love a bare Market the equity
[00:09] curves on the screen are bare market
[00:11] trading strategies only traded during a
[00:13] falling Market the video is short so
[00:16] stay tuned until the end our bare market
[00:19] trading strategy shows you that contrary
[00:21] to what many believe long only
[00:23] strategies for stocks have proven to
[00:25] perform better during a bare Market than
[00:27] a bull market first let's define bull
[00:30] and bare markets we make it simple just
[00:32] like we always do when stocks are
[00:35] trading above their 200 day moving
[00:37] average we have a bull market when
[00:39] trading below the average we have a bare
[00:42] Market let's make a simple bare Market
[00:45] strategy to show you how a simple mean
[00:47] reversion strategy performs both in a
[00:49] bull and bare Market we make the
[00:52] following trading strategy and back
[00:54] tested on NASDAQ 100 index by using the
[00:56] ETF with the ticker code QQQ
[01:00] we go long when the 2-day RSI drops
[01:03] below 10 and we sell on a day with
[01:05] strength when the close ends higher than
[01:07] yesterday's high on the screen you see
[01:10] the performance filtered by taking
[01:12] trades only when QQQ is trading above
[01:14] its 200 day moving average this is a
[01:17] bull market
[01:19] strategy the performance is good but
[01:21] let's find out if a bare Market makes
[01:23] any difference as we said earlier we
[01:25] filtered trades that happen only below
[01:27] the 200 day average
[01:30] as the equity curve shows the bare
[01:32] Market strategy has performed very well
[01:34] during all the bare markets since the
[01:36] year
[01:36] 2000 the average gain per trade is 1.3%
[01:40] and this is a lot better than during a
[01:42] bull
[01:43] market if we break down the performance
[01:46] for every year we see that the.com crash
[01:48] the financial crisis and the 2022 bare
[01:51] Market all witnessed positive gains
[01:53] despite NASDAQ falling
[01:55] significantly on the right we see the
[01:57] performance during a bare market and the
[01:59] results are better compared to a bull
[02:01] market trading during a bare Market
[02:04] might feel counterintuitive but keep in
[02:06] mind that most money is almost always
[02:08] made when things are uncertain even from
[02:11] the long side when problems eventually
[02:14] are solved prices go up use it to your
[02:17] advantage a bare Market has one added
[02:20] Advantage it's the only time when short
[02:22] seems to work let's show you a short
[02:25] strategy for QQQ available for our
[02:27] members it uses the two 100 day average
[02:30] as a trend filter and on the screen you
[02:32] see the performance on the left is the
[02:35] performance when QQQ is in a bare market
[02:38] and we see that short only works during
[02:40] a bare Market why does short work only
[02:42] in a bare Market when NASDAQ 100 and S&P
[02:46] 500 trade under its 200 day average the
[02:49] volatility is twice as high compared to
[02:51] a bull market in trading efficiency and
[02:54] volatility are inversely correlated
[02:57] volatile markets are good and
[02:59] inefficiency
[03:00] increases we might argue a volatile bare
[03:03] Market is a
[03:04] godsent that's all for today but please
[03:07] like And subscribe if you like the
