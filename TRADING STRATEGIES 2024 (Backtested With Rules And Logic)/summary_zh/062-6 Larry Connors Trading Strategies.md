讨论的交易策略基于拉里·康纳斯（Larry Connors）及其团队开发的交易策略，并进行了修改以提高绩效。 这是每种策略的简明摘要：

1. **双五交易策略** ：
   - Enter when the close is above the 200-day moving average (DMA) and at a five-day low.
   - Exit when the close is at a five-day high.
   - Produces more trades than the original Double Seven, with an average gain of 0.65% and moderate drawdowns.

2. **多天和多天下降** ：
   -在200-DMA上方，在5-DMA以下，并在过去五天中至少四个下降后输入。
   - Exit when the close is above the previous high or low.
   - Offers a 4.8% annual return with limited market exposure.

3. **RSI 30/50策略** ：
   - Enter when above the 200-DMA and the 5-day RSI is below 30.
   - Exit when the 5-day RSI crosses above 50.
   - Provides a strong risk-adjusted return of 52% with high win rates.

4. **三天的高/低策略** ：
   - Enter when above the 200-DMA and both high and low have trended lower for three consecutive days.
   -进入后的下一个关闭，或者关闭时间低于前一天的关闭。
   - Results in a 3.6% annual return with minimal market exposure.

5. **关键要点** ：
   - Mean reversion strategies (buying dips) have been effective since 1985.
   - The 200-DMA effectively filters out Bull and Bear markets, limiting drawdowns to around 14% for all strategies.
   - Strategies often remain on the sidelines, allowing potential for complementary trading.
   - Avoid combining all six strategies into a portfolio due to similarity, which can reduce effectiveness.

These strategies emphasize纪律性、风险管理，并依赖于历史数据的有效性。 在实施前，建议进行充分的测试和评估。
