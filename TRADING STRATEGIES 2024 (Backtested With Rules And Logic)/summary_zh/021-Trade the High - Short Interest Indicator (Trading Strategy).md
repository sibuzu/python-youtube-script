#### **Key Indicators**  
1. **Short Interest**:  
   - Defined as the percentage of a company's outstanding shares that have been sold short.  
   - Example: If a company has 1 billion shares outstanding and 50 million are shorted, the short interest is 5%.  
2. **Short Interest Ratio (SIR)**:  
   - Measures the average number of days it takes for short sellers to close their positions.  
   - Calculated as the total shorted shares divided by the daily trading volume of the stock.

#### **Strategy Details**  
1. High Short Interest:  
   - Stocks with high short interest (e.g., 20%) are often considered "over短" and may indicate strong conviction among short sellers.  
2. Low Short Interest:  
   - Stocks with low short interest (e.g., less than 2% in the lowest deciles) suggest limited short selling activity, which could be a sign of weaker conviction among bears.

#### **Backtesting Performance**  
1. High Short Interest Stocks:  
   - Historically, stocks with high short interest have shown weak returns over one year.  
   - The highest short interest deciles (top 20%) have demonstrated the weakest performance.  
2. Low Short Interest Stocks:  
   - Companies with low short interest outperform the average stock in terms of returns.

#### **Conclusion**  
1. **High Short Interest**:  
   - Generally associated with weak future returns, suggesting it is not a reliable indicator for identifying "multi-baggers" (stocks that increase significantly in value).  
   - The GameStop short squeeze in 2021 was an outlier and not representative of typical market behavior.  

2. **Low Short Interest**:  
   - Tend to outperform stocks with high short interest, making them a more promising target for investors seeking strong returns.  

3. **Cautionary Note**:  
   - Investors should avoid relying on anecdotal data or isolated events (e.g., short squeezes) when assessing the potential of a stock.  
   - High short interest does not guarantee future profitability and is unlikely to be a reliable indicator for identifying the next big winner.

#### **Final Thoughts**  
The article emphasizes the importance of using long-term, systematic analysis rather than relying on short-term trends or isolated events. It suggests that investors should focus on stocks with low short interest when seeking opportunities for strong returns.
