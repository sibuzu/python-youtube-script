讨论的交易策略涉及利用OpenAI开发的AI CHAT GPT来协助产生和进行回测思想。 这是一个简明的摘要：

1. **客观的** ：探索CHAT GPT是否可以通过产生和进行回测策略来成为获得交易优势的工具。

2. **训练AI** ：
   - The user needs to guide Chat GPT on what they want it for, i.e., trading.
   - Provide basic trading ideas to prompt the AI's creativity.

3. **进行回测过程** ：
   - A Bollinger Band Mean Reversion strategy was chosen for backtesting.
   -参数集：偏差系数为2的20周期布林带。
   - The strategy involves buying when the price closes below the lower band and selling when it closes above the upper band.

4. **执行** ：
   - Chat GPT was used to write Python code for backtesting using libraries like pandas, numpy, yfinance, and matplotlib.
   - The generated code was run without modifications.

5. **结果** ：
   - The strategy showed an annual return of 3.2% with 326 trades.
   - The equity curve appeared reasonable, indicating potential as a starting point for further development.

6. **结论** ：
   - Chat GPT is not a trading platform or financial advisor but can be a valuable tool for brainstorming ideas and generating backtests.
   - AI tools like Chat GPT are expected to become integral parts of quantitative models, revolutionizing the trading landscape.
