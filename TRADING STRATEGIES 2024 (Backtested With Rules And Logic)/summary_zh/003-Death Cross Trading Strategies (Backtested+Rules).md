死亡交叉交易策略是一种技术分析工具，用于识别股票市场潜在的看跌趋势。 这是基于视频的策略的简明摘要：

1. **定义和力学** ：
   - The Death Cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average (e.g., 50-day) crosses below a longer-term moving average (e.g., 200-day). This signals a potential downtrend.

2. **滞后指示器** ：
   - It is a lagging indicator, meaning it confirms trends after they have started, rather than predicting future price movements.

3. **进行回测结果** ：
   - Historical backtests since 1960 show poor performance during Death Cross periods, with minimal growth despite spending only 30% of the time in the market. This highlights the risk of missing out on market gains.

4. **限制** ：
   - Infrequent occurrence (only 32 instances since 1960) and potential for long-term underperformance due to keeping investors out of the market during upward trends.
   - Applicability varies across different markets, requiring individual backtesting.

5. **实施注意事项** ：
   - Use as part of a diversified strategy with other indicators or risk management techniques.
   - Psychological discipline is crucial, as waiting for entry signals (like the Golden Cross) can be challenging during market rises.

6. **结论** ：
   - While the Death Cross can signal significant downturns, its reliance on historical data and lack of adaptability to external factors make it a useful but limited tool. It may be more effective when combined with other strategies rather than used in isolation.
