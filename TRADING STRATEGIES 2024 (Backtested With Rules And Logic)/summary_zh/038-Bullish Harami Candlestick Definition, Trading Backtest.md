贸易策略讨论了围绕看涨的哈拉米烛台模式，该模式用于识别下降趋势中的潜在逆转。 这是一个简明的摘要：

1. **看涨圣地模式** ：
   - **结构** ：由两支蜡烛组成。
     - The first candle is a large bearish (red) candle with a long body, indicating strong selling pressure.
     - The second candle is a small bullish candle (often a doji), completely engulfed by the first candle, showing market indecision.
   - **语境** ：出现在下降期间。

2. **模式识别** ：
   - Confirmed in a downtrend with a large bearish candle followed by a small bullish candle within its body.

3. **解释** ：
   - Suggests a potential reversal as the small bullish candle indicates possible buyer interest and shifting momentum.

4. **策略规则** ：
   - Enter a trade when both the Bullish Harami is formed and the 5-day RSI is below 40.
   - Exit after holding for a specified number of days (e.g., 10 trading days).

5. **表现** ：
   - Historical backtesting on the S&P 500 showed an average gain per trade of approximately 0.95% when held for 10 days.
   -胜率从55％到70％不等，由于股价随着时间的推移而上涨，持有期间的较长时间不断提高。

6. **考虑因素** ：
   - Use with caution, as patterns can provide false signals. Combine with other indicators like RSI for better reliability.
