视频中讨论的交易策略称为 "Turnaround Tuesday" 策略是基于在股票市场观察到的季节性影响的。 这是该策略的摘要：

1. **概念** ：这个想法是，如果股票市场在周一的下降日期，则市场可能会扭转其趋势并在周二大幅上升。 相反，如果周一市场上升，则周二往往会变平或下降。

2. **交易规则** ：
   - If today is Monday and the closing price of the current trading day (Monday) is lower than Friday's close, buy at the close.
   -退出交易时，要么收盘超过前一天的高点（与星期一的高点相比，周二的闭幕式）或最多持有五天。

3. **表现** ：
   - When tested on SPY (an ETF tracking the S&P 500), the strategy produced an impressive equity curve with relatively small drawdowns.
   - The maximum drawdown was short-lived, and other drawdowns were in single digits.
   - The annualized return of the strategy is 10.6%, which is lower than the 99.8% return from a long-term buy-and-hold strategy on SPY over a period starting in 1993.

4. **与买卖的比较** ：
   - While the Turnaround Tuesday strategy has lower returns, it involves being invested only about 24% of the time, keeping 76% of the capital in cash.
   - This cash can be used for other complementary strategies.

5. **改进** ：
   - The strategy can be tweaked to improve results, which is available to paying subscribers.

6. **考虑因素** ：
   - It's important to do thorough research and ensure that this or any strategy aligns with your financial goals.
   - The strategy is not presented as investment advice, and viewers are encouraged to perform their own due diligence.
