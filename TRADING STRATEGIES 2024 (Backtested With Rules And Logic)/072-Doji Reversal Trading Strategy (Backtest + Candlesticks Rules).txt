[00:00] doji candlesticks reversals a secret
[00:02] trading weapon in this video we'll
[00:04] demonstrate an effective way to show how
[00:06] you can use the doji pattern in the
[00:08] stock market if you don't know what a
[00:09] doji is don't worry we'll show you what
[00:12] it is and how you can spot it in the
[00:13] chart after explaining what a doji is
[00:15] we'll back test it and tell you exactly
[00:17] how it performs does the doji pattern
[00:20] increase the returns compared to any
[00:21] random period we find out by back
[00:23] testing this means making specific
[00:25] trading rules and not using random
[00:27] anecdotal evidence we will also improve
[00:29] the doji strategy by making improved
[00:31] exit rules before we start we'd like to
[00:33] mention that we have back tested and
[00:35] coded all Candlestick patterns that
[00:37] exist you can purchase our research for
[00:39] a moderate fee on our website including
[00:41] the back tester code for Amy broker or
[00:43] tradestation the fact is that the 10
[00:45] best candlesticks perform very well they
[00:48] beat Buy and Hold handily despite being
[00:50] invested just 35 percent of the time
[00:52] let's return to our dojis doji trading
[00:55] strategies are popular and the doji
[00:57] pattern is one of the most famous
[00:58] Candlestick patterns there are four four
[01:00] types of dojis neutral doji gravestone
[01:03] doji dragonfly doji long-legged doji the
[01:06] four arrows in the chart show each
[01:07] different type of doji what does a doji
[01:10] signal doji's have small bodies with
[01:11] upper and lower Shadows that are of
[01:13] Greater length than the Candlestick
[01:14] body's length this presumably represents
[01:17] indecision between the Bulls and the
[01:18] Bears however we won't bore you with
[01:21] explaining doji's that is already done
[01:23] hundreds of times instead we'll back
[01:25] test to find out if they work or not we
[01:27] use the trading code we made which you
[01:29] can find on our website and we made the
[01:31] following trading rules
[01:33] Market S P 500 spy when we spot one of
[01:37] the four dojis in the chart we buy we
[01:40] sell in days later the back test
[01:42] returned the following results the First
[01:44] Column shows the number of days we are
[01:45] in the trade for example row number five
[01:48] shows the results when we sell after
[01:49] five trading days which is a zero Twenty
[01:52] Eight percent gain per trade the results
[01:54] are slightly better than any random
[01:56] period can we improve it let's try to
[01:58] add a sell criteria where we sell on
[02:00] strength to exploit the mean reversion
[02:02] effect in the market we sell when the
[02:04] close is higher than yesterday's high
[02:06] does it improve the equity curve doesn't
[02:09] show a linear upward slope but the
[02:11] average of 0.32 percent per trade over a
[02:14] four-day holding period is still better
[02:16] than any random period let's try another
[02:18] twist and we make the following trading
[02:20] rules
[02:21] Market S P 500 spy when we spot one of
[02:26] the four dojis in the chart we buy the
[02:28] five-day RSI must be below 50. we sell
[02:31] when the close is higher than
[02:32] yesterday's high the idea behind the RSI
[02:35] filter is to buy when the market is
[02:37] somewhat oversold there are a few trades
[02:39] only 62 but the average gain per trade
[02:41] improves to zero fifty four percent
[02:44] however the equity curve is not
[02:46] particularly inspiring that's all for
[02:48] now but if you'd like to know more about
[02:49] candlesticks and performance we have
