[00:01] in general when volatility picks up
[00:04] stock prices go down thus volatility
[00:08] correlates to a bear Market
[00:10] let's use the 200-day moving average as
[00:13] a market regime filter when prices are
[00:16] below the average they have a bear
[00:18] Market when a bow we have a bull market
[00:21] pretty simple
[00:23] what's the performance like if trading
[00:25] signals happen above and below this
[00:28] Market regime filter
[00:30] here we have a strategy separated by
[00:33] this Market regime and as you can see
[00:36] the strategy works better during High
[00:40] volatility than during low volatility
[00:43] thus you should just continue trading as
[00:47] if nothing happened and don't focus on
[00:49] whether to buy or sell
[00:51] it does it doesn't matter whether you
[00:53] have a bill or bear Market
