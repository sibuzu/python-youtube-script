[00:04] work trading strategy and what it is and
[00:08] as the name implies a random work
[00:11] strategy is based on boys and sales that
[00:16] are random they are completely picked at
[00:19] random so we we made the following
[00:22] strategy we make 12 trades per year and
[00:27] they are picked completely at random and
[00:30] the exit of the four trading days that's
[00:33] it and here you can see the equity curve
[00:36] and below here is the is the max
[00:38] drawdown which is at about 12 and as you
[00:42] can see it's not too bad so you have an
[00:44] average gain to trade trade about
[00:47] 0.37 and the profit factor is 1.7 so all
[00:52] in all this strategy which is completely
[00:55] random strategy is actually pretty good
