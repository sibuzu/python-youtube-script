[00:01] the super Trend indicator has a
[00:03] promising name does it live up to its
[00:05] name and can we make a profitable super
[00:08] Trend indicator
[00:09] strategy our back test reveals that the
[00:12] indicator can catch most of the returns
[00:14] while avoiding the worst draw Downs thus
[00:16] giving good risk adjusted
[00:18] returns let's show you what the super
[00:21] Trend indicator is and how it performs
[00:24] as you can see on the screen its
[00:25] performance has been pretty good first
[00:28] off what is the super trend indicator
[00:30] the super Trend indicator is a trend
[00:32] following indicator and its trading
[00:34] rules are simple the chart on the screen
[00:37] shows how the super Trend indicator
[00:39] works when the price is above the
[00:41] indicator you're long and you sell or
[00:43] reverse when it drops below before we
[00:46] present the trading rules in our back
[00:48] test let's briefly explain how the super
[00:51] Trend indicator is
[00:52] calculated the indicator consists of a
[00:55] median price added and deducted the
[00:57] average true range of a specific look
[00:59] back period period despite using two
[01:02] bands the supertrend indicator has only
[01:04] one signal line this is because the
[01:07] lower band can't decrease and the upper
[01:09] Band Can't increase thus the super Trend
[01:12] indicator takes on the values of both
[01:14] the lower and upper bands
[01:16] alternatively when the close of a bar
[01:19] crosses the value of the super Trend
[01:21] indicator from the previous period the
[01:23] indicator begins to follow the opposite
[01:24] band leading to a reversal in the trend
[01:27] a trade example is shown on the screen
[01:30] for S&P
[01:31] 500 the Buy Signal was triggered on the
[01:34] 29th of May 2020 at 3044 and the sell
[01:38] signal triggered on the 21st of January
[01:40] 2022 at
[01:42] 4397 resulting in a nice gain of
[01:46] 44% because the indicator is quite
[01:48] technical we recommend reading our
[01:50] linked article below the video for
[01:52] further
[01:53] explanation the super trend is a trend
[01:55] following indicator and it requires a
[01:57] long-term mindset we've backed tested it
[02:00] using short-term data but it works best
[02:02] on very long time frames let's show you
[02:05] a super Trend trading strategy with
[02:07] specific trading rules we buy when the
[02:10] price breaks above the indicator and
[02:12] sell when it closes below we use weekly
[02:15] bars with a 10 bar look back period and
[02:17] a multiplier of three you can of course
[02:20] try other values and we strongly
[02:22] encourage you to back test yourself we
[02:25] have the code for the indicator on our
[02:26] web page we back test SN P 500 from 1960
[02:31] until today and it Returns the equity
[02:33] curve shown on the screen 100,000
[02:36] invested in 1960s worth almost 4 million
[02:40] today it's only 38 trades since 1960 so
[02:43] it doesn't trade often the annual return
[02:45] is almost 6% not considering reinvested
[02:49] dividends please note that Max draw down
[02:51] is significantly lower compared to buy
[02:53] and hold 24% versus
[02:56] 56% because you're invested only 63% of
[03:00] the time we might argue that the risk
[03:01] adjusted return is
[03:03] 9.4% significantly higher than buy and
[03:06] hold of about
[03:08] 7% we calculated risk adjusted return by
[03:11] dividing the annual return by the time
[03:13] spent in the market it's a simple
[03:15] formula but we believe it's a very good
[03:17] proxy for risk and
[03:19] return that's all for today and good
[03:21] luck trading and
[03:25] investing
