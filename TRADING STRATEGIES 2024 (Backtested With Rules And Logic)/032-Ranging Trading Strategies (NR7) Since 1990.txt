[00:00] nr7 was first developed by Tony crabill
[00:03] back in 1990 and is a volatility
[00:04] strategy we'll explain the logic behind
[00:07] the strategy and show you how to back
[00:09] test it the main idea of nr7 is to enter
[00:11] the market when it's in a low volatility
[00:13] period ride the trend until the market
[00:16] shows signs of strength and then exit
[00:18] the range or volatility is defined as
[00:21] the difference between the daily High
[00:23] and the low if today has the lowest
[00:25] range of the previous last six trading
[00:27] days then we go long at the close the
[00:30] exit is at the close when today's close
[00:32] is higher than yesterday's high to
[00:34] demonstrate this strategy we'll be back
[00:36] testing it on the S P 500 by using the
[00:39] ETF with the ticker code spy let's look
[00:41] at a trading example the Green Arrow
[00:43] shows a day when the daily range is
[00:45] lower than the previous six trading days
[00:47] thus we go long at the close the next
[00:49] day S P 500 rallies and the close is
[00:52] higher than yesterday's high we exit at
[00:54] the close for a nice gain when we back
[00:56] test this strategy from 1993 until today
[00:59] we start with 1 100 000 USD and end up
[01:02] with an equity curve that shows an
[01:03] upward slope the average gain per trade
[01:05] is zero twenty six percent max drawdown
[01:08] is twenty five percent and the annual
[01:09] return is seven point six percent the
[01:12] annual return is slightly below buy and
[01:14] holds 9.7 percent however the strategy
[01:17] is only invested 37 percent of the time
[01:19] and the risk-adjusted return is hence 20
[01:21] percent can the strategy be improved yes
[01:24] if we use the 200-day moving average
[01:26] Trend filter we reduce Max drawdown to
[01:28] 15 percent while the average gain stays
[01:31] the same that's all for today if you
