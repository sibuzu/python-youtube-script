[00:00] chat GPT has been on everyone's mind
[00:02] lately people are discussing how it can
[00:04] improve productivity or help you solve
[00:07] programming bugs but can chat GPT be
[00:09] used for back testing
[00:11] in this video we'll explore how chat GPT
[00:13] can help you with trading and we back
[00:16] test a trading strategy using chat GPT
[00:19] as Traders we're always looking for new
[00:21] ways to gain an edge in the market can
[00:23] chat GPT be that trading Edge
[00:26] chat GPT an AI system developed by open
[00:29] AI launched in November 2022 and has
[00:32] already attracted a million users in
[00:34] just five days
[00:36] by January 2023 chat GPT had a hundred
[00:39] million active users according to an
[00:41] analysis by UBS it's the fastest product
[00:44] to reach that amount in history
[00:46] surpassing companies like Instagram and
[00:49] tick tock
[00:50] that must indicate it offers Great Value
[00:52] right
[00:54] let's try to back test a trading
[00:56] strategy using chat GPT
[00:58] first unlock chat GPT to its full
[01:01] potential for trading we need to train
[01:03] it to do what we want we tell it what
[01:05] we'll use it for and what we want
[01:08] it may seem silly but now the AI machine
[01:10] knows what we expect to get from it
[01:13] we could give it some basic trading
[01:15] ideas to see what it comes up with as
[01:17] you can see on the screen chat GPT can
[01:19] sometimes give incorrect answers
[01:21] the mean reversion and Trend following
[01:24] strategy are virtually the same and this
[01:26] doesn't make sense
[01:27] we can ask you to expand and provide
[01:30] other ideas it's not always detailed but
[01:32] you can always ask it to dig deeper
[01:35] let's backtest a trading strategy
[01:37] generated by chat GPT we use the
[01:40] Bollinger band mean reversion strategy
[01:42] well as chat GPT to write a Python
[01:45] program to back test the strategy using
[01:47] pandas numpy why finance and matplotlib
[01:51] we'll run the code in Python without
[01:52] changing a thing
[01:54] the strategy that chat GPT back test
[01:56] that is the following
[01:58] it sets the Bollinger Bands parameters
[02:00] to a period of 20 in a deviation factor
[02:03] of 2. it buys when the price closes
[02:05] below the lower band and sells it when
[02:08] it closes above the upper band
[02:10] these strategies Equity curve looks like
[02:12] this on s p 500. the equity curve chat
[02:16] GPT generated looks reasonably good of
[02:19] course we can't expect chat GPT to hand
[02:21] us a killer strategy but it provides a
[02:23] great starting point to build your own
[02:25] models and strategies
[02:27] the boeinger band mean reversion
[02:29] strategy had annual returns of 3.2
[02:31] percent and it made 326 trades and the
[02:35] time spent in the market was 45.63
[02:37] percent
[02:39] chat GPT is not a trading platform and
[02:42] it does not provide Financial advice or
[02:44] make investment decisions
[02:46] however it can be a helpful tool for
[02:48] brainstorming trading ideas and
[02:50] generating back tests in python or
[02:52] whatever platform you're using
[02:54] it won't take long before AI tools like
[02:57] this become a central part of
[02:58] quantitative models chat GPT is a truly
[03:01] revolutionary program that will surely
[03:03] Market before and after in the history
[03:06] of AI
