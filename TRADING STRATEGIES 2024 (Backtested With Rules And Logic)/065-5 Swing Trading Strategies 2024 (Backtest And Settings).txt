[00:00] is one video you won't want to miss
[00:02] before we start we remind you that you
[00:04] find our best strategies on our webpage
[00:06] mind you even though the strategies in
[00:08] this video are great they are not our
[00:10] best okay let's get back to our five
[00:12] free and proven swing strategies first
[00:14] let's start by explaining swing trading
[00:16] swing trading is a dynamic strategy that
[00:18] involves holding a tradable asset for
[00:20] one or more days with the aim of
[00:22] profiting from price changes or swings
[00:24] that's right we're talking about
[00:25] capitalizing on short-term price
[00:27] movements in this video we only look at
[00:30] the stock market and we back test the
[00:32] ETF that tracks S P 500 spy you can most
[00:35] likely also trade the Futures Contract
[00:37] unlike day trading where positions are
[00:39] opened and closed within the same day
[00:41] swing trading positions are held for
[00:43] longer periods but not quite as long as
[00:45] Buy and Hold investment strategies so
[00:48] you get the best of both worlds the
[00:50] potential for big gains without the
[00:51] stress of constantly monitoring the
[00:53] markets we aim to exploit the long-term
[00:55] Rising Trend in the stock market but we
[00:57] buy on short-term weakness and panics
[00:59] the art shows you an example we want to
[01:02] buy when the price deviates from the
[01:04] longer Trend and sell when the market is
[01:06] strong we buy weakness and sell strength
[01:08] okay now let's jump to the trading rules
[01:10] of our first strategy in the first
[01:12] strategy we want to enter when the price
[01:14] has dropped from a recent High we
[01:16] calculate a band that is based on the 25
[01:18] day average of the difference of the
[01:20] daily highs and lows when spy closes
[01:23] below the ban deducted from the 10-day
[01:25] high and IBS is lower than 0.3 we go
[01:29] long we have explained the IBS indicator
[01:31] in a separate video which contains three
[01:33] free strategies we also need to make a
[01:36] rule for the exit because we want to
[01:38] sell on strength to exploit the mean
[01:39] reversion effect we sell when today's
[01:41] close is above yesterday's high let's
[01:44] show you a trade example the red line in
[01:46] the chart shows the 10-day High the blue
[01:49] line is calculated by using the average
[01:51] range of high and low and deduct it from
[01:53] the 10-day High the lower pain in the
[01:55] chart shows the IBS indicator we buy
[01:58] when spy closes below the blue line and
[02:00] when the IBS indicator is below 0.3
[02:03] green arrows show when we buy and red
[02:05] arrows when we sell let's find out how
[02:08] the strategy performed from 1993 until
[02:10] today we've back tested the strategy and
[02:13] Amy broker and our starting capital of
[02:14] 100
[02:15] 000 in year 1993 grows to 175 million in
[02:19] 2023. this is an annual return of 10
[02:22] slightly better than Buy and Hold
[02:24] despite being invested just 18 percent
[02:26] of the time because of less time spent
[02:28] in the market the max drawdown is also
[02:30] substantially lower at 23 percent versus
[02:32] buy and holds 55 percent thus we might
[02:35] also argue the risk-adjusted return is
[02:37] 55 percent we calculate The
[02:39] risk-adjusted Return by taking the
[02:41] annual return of 10 percent and divide
[02:43] it by zero eighteen which is the
[02:45] percentage of time spent in the market
[02:47] let's go to our second strategy for the
[02:49] day and its trading rules we buy at the
[02:51] close on Monday if the close is lower
[02:53] for the second day in a row we exit when
[02:55] the close is higher than yesterday's
[02:57] high the name of the strategy is perhaps
[02:59] better known as his turnaround Tuesday
[03:01] because the market often rallies on
[03:03] Tuesdays after a week Monday let's look
[03:05] at some trade samples the green arrows
[03:07] show Mondays where the closest down for
[03:09] the second time in a row and the red
[03:11] arrows are when we sell on strength all
[03:13] five trades shown here are profitable
[03:15] but it is of course not always the case
[03:17] because trading also involves losing
[03:19] trades let's look at the bigger picture
[03:21] and look at the equity curve of the
[03:23] strategy since 1994 until today a 100
[03:27] 000 investment would have compounded
[03:28] annually at 8.2 percent from 1993 until
[03:31] today the equity curve Rises steadily
[03:34] and the equity would have grown to 1.058
[03:36] Million by today not too bad for such a
[03:39] simple strategy there are 271 trades
[03:42] that on average is invested just four
[03:43] days thus making you invested just 11
[03:45] percent of the time and hence avoiding
[03:47] the worst drawdowns Max drawdown is at
[03:50] only 16 percent again the risk-adjusted
[03:52] return is very high at 74 percent let's
[03:55] go to our third proven swing strategy we
[03:57] buy spy when the close is lower than the
[03:59] low of the pre previous five trading
[04:01] days that's it we buy on a five day low
[04:03] as usual we sell when the close ends
[04:06] higher than yesterday's high in this
[04:07] slide we see five trading examples all
[04:10] of them winners obviously not all turn
[04:12] out to be winners but the win rate is
[04:14] very high as is typical for mean
[04:16] reversion strategies if we look at the
[04:19] equity curve of the strategy it's hard
[04:21] not to be impressed of such a simple
[04:22] strategy you started with one hundred
[04:24] thousand in 1993 and end up with 1.4
[04:27] million today despite being invested
[04:29] just 21 percent of the time as you can
[04:32] see the trading performance is really
[04:34] good you are invested only 21 of the
[04:36] time and you still get a return that
[04:38] equals buy and hold you take advantage
[04:40] of the ebb and flow in the market to get
[04:42] a risk-adjusted return of 43 percent
[04:44] again it shows that Simplicity works in
[04:46] the stock market as a matter of fact
[04:48] Simplicity trumps complexity let's go to
[04:51] today's fourth strategy this one is a
[04:53] bit different compared to the first
[04:55] three because it's mainly based on
[04:56] volatility and to a lesser extent mean
[04:59] reversion these are the trading rules we
[05:02] buy when today's range is lower than the
[05:04] daily range the previous six trading
[05:06] days and the close must be above the
[05:09] 200-day moving average the 200-day
[05:12] moving average serves as a trend filter
[05:14] we only want to take trades when the
[05:16] market is bullish yet again we exit when
[05:19] today's close ends above yesterday's
[05:21] high the Green Arrow shows a day when
[05:23] the daily range is lower than the
[05:24] previous six trading days and above the
[05:27] 200-day moving average thus we go long
[05:30] at the close the next day S P 500
[05:33] rallies and the close is higher than
[05:35] yesterday's high we exit at the close
[05:37] for a nice 0.58 percent gain let's look
[05:40] at how your Equity would have grown if
[05:42] you traded all signals from 1993 until
[05:44] today we start with a hundred thousand
[05:46] USD in 1993 and let it compound until
[05:48] today as you can see the equity shows an
[05:51] upward slope there are a few setbacks
[05:53] along the way but overall the strategy
[05:54] performs pretty well the statistics are
[05:57] not as good as the previous three
[05:58] strategies but as you'll see at the end
[06:00] of the video the strategy complements
[06:02] the other strategies well let's go to
[06:04] our last back-tested and proven swing
[06:06] trading strategy our last strategy is
[06:09] somewhat different than the others this
[06:10] is a strategy we made six years ago and
[06:13] it has lately worked better than ever
[06:15] the trading rules are very simple
[06:17] today's high must be higher than the
[06:19] high of the last 10 days and the IBS
[06:21] indicator must be below 0.15 if both are
[06:25] true we buy the clothes we use the same
[06:28] sell signal as in all the four other
[06:29] strategies when the close is higher than
[06:32] yesterday's high let's show you a few
[06:34] trade examples the seven trades turn out
[06:36] five profitable ones in our sample we
[06:39] buy on a weekday when spy closes in the
[06:41] bottom of its daily range but it still
[06:43] managed to set a new 10-day High earlier
[06:46] in the trading session the equity curve
[06:48] is pretty good right it's the strategy
[06:49] with the fewest trades but the slope is
[06:51] up it was only 161 trades and the
[06:54] average gain was 0.6 percent per trade
[06:57] you were invested less than a week on
[06:59] average and the annual return was 3.24
[07:02] percent but that low number is due to
[07:04] being invested only seven percent of the
[07:06] time however the strategy has the lowest
[07:08] drawdown at only eight percent we have
[07:11] now presented you five free and proven
[07:13] swing strategies but let's go on to do
[07:15] the final back test of the day we trade
[07:18] all strategies at the same time but we
[07:20] allocate one hundred percent of the
[07:21] equity to one position thus ignoring buy
[07:24] signals if we already have a position
[07:25] because we use the same sell signal in
[07:28] all five strategies there are no
[07:30] conflicts with the exits when we add all
[07:32] five strategies we get a lot more trades
[07:34] the trade sample shown here indicates
[07:36] that you and some periods get many
[07:38] trades but how do the five strategies
[07:40] perform together let's back test and
[07:42] find out your initial one hundred
[07:44] thousand in 1993 would have grown to 5.3
[07:47] million that's the beauty of compounding
[07:49] returns it's snowballs remember the
[07:51] scale on the right side is logarithmic
[07:53] not linear and thus we see relative
[07:55] changes the five strategies combined
[07:58] would have had only three losing years
[08:00] 2011 2015 and 2018 were the only losing
[08:04] years perhaps better in bad years like
[08:06] 2008 and 2022 for example the strategies
[08:09] went on to make 20.9 and 14 18.3 percent
[08:12] we can assure you it feels great to make
[08:14] money when the market is down and our
[08:15] strategies only trades from the long
[08:17] side believe us a bear Market is not
[08:19] only good for short strategies but also
[08:21] short-term long trades tend to improve
[08:23] because of the increased volatility
[08:25] let's sum up the statistics for all five
[08:27] strategies combined the 1131 trades
[08:30] returned an average of 0.38 percent and
[08:32] it amounts to a compounding return of
[08:34] 14.1 percent that is significantly
[08:36] better than Buy and Hold even though the
[08:39] strategies in total are invested only
[08:40] half the time this shows the power of
[08:43] combining strategies and perhaps even
[08:45] better the results can be improved but
[08:48] that is for another video we stop here
[08:50] for today and hope you like And
