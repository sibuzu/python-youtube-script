[00:00] hey there and welcome back to our
[00:01] Channel where we explore various trading
[00:03] strategies and techniques in today's
[00:05] video we'll be answering the question
[00:07] that's been on the minds of many Traders
[00:08] what exactly is hikanashi and can you
[00:11] use it to make profitable trading
[00:13] strategies please stay to the end and
[00:15] we'll show you a back-tested and proven
[00:17] Trend following hikanashi strategy as
[00:19] you'll find out the main advantage of
[00:21] hikanashi is its use as a trend
[00:23] following charting indicator the first
[00:25] question we answer is what exactly is
[00:28] haikinashi hikanashi is a charting
[00:31] technique that was imported to the west
[00:32] from Japan in the second half of the
[00:34] 1980s and has gained tremendous
[00:36] popularity since then hikanashi is a
[00:39] representation of prices aimed at
[00:40] highlighting the presence of Trends or
[00:42] phases of consolidation it's essentially
[00:45] another version of Japanese candlesticks
[00:47] but with a different approach to
[00:48] indicating the trend the name itself
[00:50] implies that it originates from Japan
[00:52] and is another version of the famous
[00:54] Japanese candlesticks used in charting
[00:56] hiking Ashi means average bar in
[00:58] Japanese which sums up up the difference
[01:00] between the two forms of candlesticks
[01:02] let's go on to show you how to calculate
[01:04] hikanashi unfortunately the formula is
[01:06] not straightforward and is a bit
[01:08] complicated put short hikanashi Smooths
[01:10] the candlesticks using average open high
[01:12] low and close values however the open
[01:15] and close are calculated differently for
[01:17] hey kanashi it's not the actual Prince
[01:19] but a mathematical formula is used to
[01:21] make artificial values this is also its
[01:24] main advantage to eliminate noise in
[01:26] prices to find Trends hikanashi is
[01:28] dependent on the previous hakenashi
[01:30] values because the open price is the
[01:33] midpoint of the body of the previous
[01:34] candle every hikanashi candle starts at
[01:37] the midpoint of the previous one thus
[01:40] there are no gaps in hakanashi charts
[01:42] can you trade directly on hikanashi
[01:44] charts unfortunately not what looks easy
[01:46] on the chart is not so easy in real
[01:48] trading it's important to note that hey
[01:50] kanashi does not show the real prices so
[01:53] it is impossible to trade directly on
[01:54] them and it's a lagging indicator is a
[01:57] disadvantage the upper part on the
[01:58] screen shows normal can Candlestick bars
[02:01] while the lower part shows hiking Ashi
[02:03] bars as you can see it's pretty
[02:04] different charting techniques the four
[02:06] prices that characterize a traditional
[02:08] Candlestick are the actual prices while
[02:10] haykin Ashi candlesticks are not real
[02:12] prices and can deviate a lot from
[02:15] traditional Candlestick as indicated on
[02:17] the screen this is the haken ashi's main
[02:19] disadvantage the main difference between
[02:21] classical candlesticks and hakanashi is
[02:23] that while candlesticks show The Daily
[02:25] price action of the Open high low and
[02:27] close hiking Ashi aims to indicate the
[02:30] trend by smoothing the price movements
[02:32] it is used as a supplement for other
[02:34] indicators and can help eliminate noise
[02:36] in the prices to bring out the
[02:38] directional component or the
[02:39] consolidation phases some viewers might
[02:42] wonder is hiking Ashi better than
[02:44] candlesticks which is most accurate that
[02:47] is of course impossible to answer it
[02:48] depends how you use them we have
[02:50] Quantified all Candlestick patterns that
[02:53] exist which you can purchase in our
[02:54] online shop but we also show you a very
[02:57] good hake and Ashi strategy in this
[02:59] video thus both tools are useful we
[03:01] can't say that any technique is better
[03:03] than the other which time frame is best
[03:05] for hiking Ashi the best time frame for
[03:08] hakanashi is most likely a long time
[03:10] frame for example monthly bars we use a
[03:12] monthly time frame in this video we have
[03:14] not been successful in back testing
[03:16] hikanashi for day trading or swing
[03:18] trading for short time frames We Believe
[03:20] traditional candlesticks are better now
[03:23] that we have a basic understanding of
[03:24] haikanashi let's explore a specific and
[03:26] profitable hikanashi strategy we will
[03:29] apply the following trading rules we buy
[03:31] when the close of hakanashi crosses
[03:33] above haikanashi open and we sell when
[03:36] the opposite happens it's a simple
[03:37] strategy that we backtest on the S P 500
[03:40] Index from 1960 until today on a monthly
[03:43] time frame the resulting equity line
[03:45] shows that this strategy is a trend
[03:47] following strategy that works best on
[03:49] long time frames the performance metrics
[03:52] are good and the low win ratio is
[03:54] typical of a trend following trading
[03:56] system the annual return is 4.77 percent
[04:00] while it's lower than Buy and Hold which
[04:02] is seven percent the main advantage of
[04:04] the strategy is that Max drawdown is
[04:07] much lower at 30 percent compared to buy
[04:09] and holds 53 percent in conclusion
[04:11] hikanashi is a useful charting technique
[04:13] that can help eliminate noise in the
[04:15] prices and bring out the directional
[04:16] component or the consolidation phases
[04:18] while it's not a direct representation
[04:21] of real prices it can still be used to
[04:23] extract profitable trading strategies
[04:24] however we recommend to back test your
[04:27] trading idea before you commit real
[04:29] money we hope this video has helped you
[04:31] gain a better understanding of hakanashi
[04:33] and how it can be used in algorithmic
[04:35] trading thanks for watching and we'll
