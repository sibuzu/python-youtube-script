The trading strategy presented involves using the Relative Vigor Index (RVI) as a momentum indicator. Here's a concise summary of the strategy:

1. **Definition and Calculation**:
   - The RVI measures price momentum by comparing closing prices to their trading range.
   - It includes a signal line, which is a simple moving average used to smooth results.

2. **Strategy Rules**:
   - A 5-day lookback period is used.
   - **Buy Signal**: Execute a buy when the RVI crosses above its signal line and the 5-day RSI of the RVI is below 50.
   - **Sell Signal**: Sell when the RVI crosses below its signal line.

3. **Performance**:
   - Tested on GLD (gold ETF), the strategy yielded an average gain of 0.44% per trade with a win rate of 51%, though winners outweighed losers in size.
   - The strategy was not effective on assets like the S&P 500 or bonds, indicating it may work better in specific market conditions.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - While the RVI is underutilized and showed promise on GLD, its effectiveness can vary across different assets. Further testing and adaptation are recommended for broader applicability.
