The trading strategy discussed focuses on the relationship between bonds and stocks, particularly examining what happens to stocks when bonds decline. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Key Insight**: The strategy is based on the inverse relationship between stocks and interest rates. When interest rates rise (bonds go down), it becomes less attractive to hold riskier assets like stocks.

2. **Strategy Overview**:
   - **Entry Signal**: Buy stocks (using SPY as a proxy) when bond prices (using TLT, an ETF for 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds) fall below their moving average.
   - **Exit Signal**: Sell stocks when bond prices rise above their moving average.

3. **Backtesting Results**:
   - The strategy was backtested using different moving averages (5 to 100 days).
   - For the 15-day moving average, the strategy showed weak performance compared to SPY's historical returns.
   - Annual return was less than 1%, with a maximum drawdown of 50%.

4. **Interesting Observation**: Reversing the buy/sell signals (buying when bonds rise and selling when bonds fall) yielded better results, which will be explored in a subsequent video.

This strategy aims to capitalize on the inverse relationship between stocks and bonds but showed limited success in backtesting, suggesting potential room for improvement or alternative approaches.
