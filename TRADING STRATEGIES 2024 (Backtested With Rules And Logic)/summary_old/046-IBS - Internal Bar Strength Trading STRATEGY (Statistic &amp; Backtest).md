The trading strategy introduced in the video revolves around the Internal Bar Strength (IBS) indicator, which is calculated as (Today's Close - Low) / (Today's High - Low). This indicator fluctuates between 0 and 1, with low values indicating a weak close near the daily low and high values indicating a strong close near the daily high. The strategy aims to capitalize on short-term market pullbacks using mean reversion principles.

Three specific strategies are outlined:

1. **First Strategy**: Buy when IBS is below 0.1 and sell when it exceeds 0.9. Backtesting on QQQ (Nasdaq-100 ETF) showed a significant return, with an annualized growth rate of over 12% from 2000 to 2023, despite being invested only 38% of the time.

2. **Second Strategy**: Uses a two-day average of the IBS indicator. Buy when the average is below 0.25 and sell when it exceeds 0.75. Backtesting on XLP (Consumer Staples ETF) resulted in steady growth, with an annualized return of 6.3% from 2000 onwards, invested only 33% of the time.

3. **Third Strategy**: Combines the IBS indicator with a three-day RSI. Buy when RSI is below 30 and IBS is below 0.2; sell when either the price exceeds yesterday's high or IBS exceeds 0.9. Backtesting on SPY (S&P 500 ETF) demonstrated robust performance, yielding an annualized return of 9.6% since 1993, with only 18% investment time and a Max drawdown of 23%.

Overall, the IBS indicator is highlighted as a powerful tool for short-term trading, offering significant returns with relatively low risk when used appropriately. The strategies emphasize simplicity and effectiveness, making them accessible to traders looking for systematic approaches in volatile markets.
