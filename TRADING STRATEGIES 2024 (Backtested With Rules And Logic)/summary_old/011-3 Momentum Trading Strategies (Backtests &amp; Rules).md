The trading video discusses three distinct momentum trading strategies, each tailored for different assets and market conditions. Here's a summary of the key points covered:

### 1. **First Momentum Strategy: 100-Day High/Low Close**
   - **Rules**: 
     - Go long when the closing price crosses above the highest close in the past 100 days.
     - Sell when the closing price crosses below the lowest close in the past 100 days.
   - **Backtest Results**:
     - Applied to the S&P 500 from 1960 to present.
     - Starting capital of $100,000 grows to $5.5 million over 60 years, yielding ~6.5% annualized returns (excluding dividends; ~8.5% with dividends).
   - **Performance**:
     - Engages in the market only 69% of the time.
     - Low drawdowns and risk-adjusted returns, outperforming a "Buy & Hold" strategy during major bear markets.

### 2. **Second Momentum Strategy: 25-Day High Close for Assets with Price Spikes**
   - **Rules**:
     - Buy when the closing price sets a new high over the past 25 days.
     - Sell when the closing price drops below this high.
   - **Backtest Results**:
     - Applied to Bitcoin, showing significant growth (though results are influenced by Bitcoin's overall rise).
     - Market participation is low (~13.9% of the time), yet performance remains competitive with "Buy & Hold."
   - **Performance**:
     - Low drawdowns and solid risk-adjusted returns, suitable for volatile assets like Bitcoin.

### 3. **Third Momentum Strategy: Sector Rotation System**
   - **Rules**:
     - Monthly rebalancing by ranking four ETFs (S&P 500 (SPY), Long-Term Treasuries (TLT), Developed Markets (EFA), and Emerging Markets (EEM)) based on their prior three-month performance.
     - Invest in the top-performing asset each month.
   - **Backtest Results**:
     - Starting capital of $100,000 grows to ~$1.4 million over 20 years (~13.1% annualized returns).
   - **Performance**:
     - Drawdowns are manageable (e.g., ~34%), with relatively low correlation to the stock market.
     - Slowed performance in recent years, likely due to market changes.

### Key Takeaways on Momentum Strategies
- **Momentum vs. Mean Reversion**: Emphasizes buying strength rather than weakness.
- **Optimal Settings**:
  - Time frames: 3 to 12 months for stocks; other assets may vary (e.g., daily or weekly).
  - Asset Classes: Effective across various classes, including stocks and commodities.
- **Success Factors**:
  - Backtesting is crucial.
  - Combine with indicators (e.g., using momentum with a monthly time frame but entering on daily pullbacks).
  - Use demo accounts for testing before live trading.
