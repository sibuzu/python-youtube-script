The trading strategy discussed focuses on identifying oversold conditions in the stock market using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Oversold Condition**: The strategy defines an oversold market as one that has experienced a period of falling prices, typically for five days on a daily trading frame.

2. **RSI Indicator**: The RSI is used to measure the velocity of price movements. When RSI values are below 20, it indicates an oversold condition, suggesting undervalued securities and potential upward movement.

3. **Trading Rules**:
   - **Entry**: Buy SPX (S&P 500) at the close when the three-day RSI is below 20.
   - **Exit**: Sell at the close after N days or when the next day's price is higher than yesterday's high, whichever comes first.

4. **Back Testing Results**:
   - The strategy shows steady equity growth from $100,000 to $1.3 million over the tested period.
   - Annualized returns of 9.14% with low drawdowns.
   - Risk-adjusted return calculated as 54 (annual return divided by time in the market).

5. **Conclusion**: The strategy suggests that higher short-term returns can be expected during oversold conditions, making it a potentially effective approach for traders looking to capitalize on mean reversion.

This summary highlights a systematic approach to trading based on oversold conditions and RSI, aiming to maximize risk-adjusted returns through selective market participation.
