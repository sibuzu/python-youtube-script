The trading strategy described is a **Multiple Time Frame Trading Strategy** designed to capitalize on longer-term trends while entering trades during short-term pullbacks. Here's a concise summary:

### Key Components:
1. **Long-Term Trend Filter**: The close must be higher than the close 250 days ago.
   - This ensures that the asset is in an uptrend over the long term.

2. **Intermediate Trend Filter**: The close must be higher than the close 22 days ago.
   - This confirms that the asset is trending upward on a medium-term basis.

3. **Short-Term Pullback Entry**: The close today must be a three-day low of the close.
   - This means entering the trade when the price pulls back to a short-term support level.

4. **Exit Rule**: Sell at the close when the close is higher than yesterday's close.
   - This exit rule aims to lock in profits as soon as the price moves upward from the entry point.

### Example:
The strategy was applied to the **XLP ETF**, which tracks Consumer Staples, with the following results:

- **Number of Trades**: 316
- **Average Gain per Trade**: 0.28%
- **Win Rate**: 73%
- **Maximum Drawdown**: -10%
- **Profit Factor**: 2

### Strategy Evaluation:
The strategy shows reasonable performance, with a decent win rate and profit factor. However, the average gain per trade is relatively low, which might indicate that the strategy relies on frequent small wins rather than occasional large gains.

### Conclusion:
This strategy combines multiple time frames to align entries with longer-term trends while using short-term pullbacks for entries. It appears to work well for the XLP ETF but may require testing on other assets and market conditions. For more details, you can refer to the source or contact the creators.
