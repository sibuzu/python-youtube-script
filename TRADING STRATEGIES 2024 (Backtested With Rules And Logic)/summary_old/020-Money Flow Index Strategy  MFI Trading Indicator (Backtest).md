The trading strategy discussed is based on the Money Flow Index (MFI) indicator, which combines price and volume data to measure buying and selling pressure. Here's a concise summary:

1. **What is MFI?**
   - The MFI oscillates between 0 and 100, indicating overbought (above 80) or oversold (below 20) conditions.
   - It helps predict potential price reversals by showing money flow into or out of a security.

2. **Strategy Rules:**
   - Use a short look-back period (tested with 2 days).
   - Buy when the MFI is below 10 and close at the end of the second day.
   - Sell when the closing price exceeds the previous day's high.
   - Time stop set to 10 trading days.

3. **Performance:**
   - Backtesting from 1993 showed a significant return, turning $100k into over $2M (a 20x increase).
   - Annualized return of ~10.5% vs. buy-and-hold at ~9.7%, with the strategy being invested only 35% of the time.

4. **Considerations:**
   - Combining MFI with other indicators can enhance effectiveness but requires careful backtesting to avoid curve fitting.
   - Limitations include sensitivity to volatility and potential false signals, which are part of trading risks.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The strategy is simple, effective, and suitable for novice traders. Backtesting is recommended to customize settings based on specific assets.

This strategy leverages the MFI's ability to identify overbought/oversold conditions, aiming to capitalize on short-term price movements while keeping the approach straightforward and easy to execute.
