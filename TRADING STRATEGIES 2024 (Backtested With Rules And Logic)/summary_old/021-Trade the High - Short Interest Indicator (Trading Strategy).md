The trading strategy discussed in the video revolves around analyzing short interest in stocks. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Definition of Short Interest**: 
   - Short interest is the percentage of a company's outstanding shares that have been sold short.
   - Example: If a company has 1 billion shares and 50 million are shorted, the short interest is 5%.

2. **Short Interest Ratio**:
   - This measures how many days it would take for short sellers to cover their positions, based on average daily trading volume.

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - The video references a study showing that stocks with high short interest (top deciles) tend to underperform in the subsequent year.
   - Conversely, stocks with low short interest outperform the market average.

4. **Outliers and Anecdotal Data**:
   - While exceptions like GameStop exist (where short squeezes lead to massive price increases), these are rare.
   - The strategy advises against relying on such outlier cases for making investment decisions.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - High short interest is generally associated with weaker future returns, suggesting it's "bad" for stock performance.
   - Investors should focus on stocks with low short interest if they aim to find the next multi-bagger.

The video emphasizes avoiding anecdotal data and focusing on historical trends to make informed trading decisions.
