The trading strategy described is a momentum-based sector rotation approach that involves rotating among four ETFs: SPY (S&P 500), TLT (long-term Treasuries), EFA (non-US developed markets), and EEM (emerging markets). Here's a structured summary of the strategy and considerations:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Sector Rotation**: The strategy involves switching investments between different asset classes or ETFs based on their recent performance.
2. **Monthly Ranking**: Each month, the ETFs are ranked based on their performance from the previous month.
3. **Selection and Holding**: The ETF with the best performance is selected to go long for a one-month holding period. This process is repeated monthly.

### Key Features:
- **Diversification**: The ETFs cover US equities, bonds, international developed markets, and emerging markets, providing exposure to different asset classes.
- **Performance**: Backtesting indicated an annual return of 10.1% with an average gain per trade of 1.3%, performing well until 2022.

### Considerations and Questions:
1. **Transaction Costs**: Frequent trading could incur significant fees, potentially reducing profitability. The impact of these costs on the strategy's returns is unclear.
2. **Tiebreakers**: The process for handling equal performance among ETFs (e.g., tiebreakers) isn't specified.
3. **Portfolio Construction**: The strategy doesn't mention holding cash; it always holds an ETF, which may lead to forced investments during poor-performing periods.
4. **Risk Management**: Lacks explicit risk management beyond switching ETFs, potentially exposing the portfolio to significant drawdowns if an ETF crashes during the holding period.
5. **Market Cycles and Drawdowns**: The strategy's performance across different market cycles (e.g., bear markets) is not detailed, and volatility in returns isn't addressed.
6. **Comparison with Other Strategies**: The strategy hasn't been compared to buy-and-hold or other methods like equal-weighting. Metrics like Sharpe ratio would provide deeper insights into risk-adjusted returns.
7. **Implementation Details**: The mention of an "email broker" is unclear, but it likely refers to a brokerage account suitable for frequent trading with low fees.
8. **Survivorship Bias**: Potential issues with backtesting results not accounting for underperforming strategies that aren't included.

### Conclusion:
The strategy leverages momentum across asset classes through monthly rotation, offering diversification benefits and historical performance. However, it raises questions about transaction costs, risk management, and sustainability across varying market conditions. Further analysis would be needed to evaluate its robustness and effectiveness in different environments.
