The trading strategy discussed focuses on identifying and capitalizing on "reversal days" in the market. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Bullish Reversal Day Strategy**:
   - **Conditions**: 
     - Today's low is lower than yesterday's low.
     - Today's close is higher than yesterday's close.
     - The 5-day RSI (Relative Strength Index) must be below 35, indicating oversold conditions.
   - **Execution**:
     - Enter the trade on the reversal day (green arrows).
     - Exit after holding for up to 24 days based on backtesting results in Gold (GLD), which showed optimal performance with an average gain of 2.02% when exited after 24 days.
   - **Performance**:
     - The strategy demonstrated a positive profit factor across multiple exit points, suggesting reliability.

2. **Bearish Reversal Day Strategy**:
   - **Conditions**:
     - Today's high is higher than yesterday's high.
     - Today's close is lower than yesterday's close.
     - The 5-day RSI must be above 65, indicating overbought conditions.
   - **Execution**:
     - Enter the trade on the reversal day (green arrows).
     - Exit after holding for up to 24 days.
   - **Performance**:
     - While profitable, returns were significantly lower than the bullish strategy. This underperformance was partly attributed to Gold's long-term upward bias, making it challenging to profit from short positions.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The bullish reversal day strategy performed better in backtesting.
   - The bearish strategy faced difficulties due to the asset's (Gold) inherent upward trend.
   - Both strategies are part of a broader offering for subscribers, including courses and resources available on the provider's website.
