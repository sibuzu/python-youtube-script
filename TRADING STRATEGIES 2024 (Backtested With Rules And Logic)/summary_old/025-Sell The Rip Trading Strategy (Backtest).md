The trading strategy discussed is called "Sell The Rip," which is based on the concept that financial markets move in waves, rising and falling. This strategy focuses on selling assets when they reach an overvalued level, aiming to capture profits at market highs.

### Key Points of the Strategy:
1. **Traditional Mean Reversion Strategy**:
   - Uses the 3-day RSI (Relative Strength Index) as a signal.
   - Buys when the RSI drops below 30 and sells when it reaches 70.
   - Results in erratic performance with high drawdowns (reaching 35% twice), making it difficult for traders to stick with.

2. **Improved "Sell The Rip" Signal**:
   - Sells when the closing price exceeds yesterday's high, indicating potential overvaluation.
   - Improves performance significantly compared to the original strategy:
     - Reduces drawdowns (only twice exceeding 20%).
     - Maintains competitive annual returns while keeping the invested time low (~27% of the time).

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Generates consistent returns with lower risk.
   - Annual returns are comparable to a "Buy and Hold" strategy but with less time in the market.

4. **Market Suitability**:
   - Works best for stock markets, where mean reversion is more common.
   - Less effective for commodities and forex, which tend to trend rather than revert.

### Conclusion:
The improved "Sell The Rip" strategy offers a viable approach for traders seeking to capitalize on overvalued assets. However, it's important to backtest the strategy for each specific market to determine its effectiveness. While it doesn't work universally across all markets, it provides a solid framework for trading in environments with mean reversion characteristics.
