The Williams Percentage R trading strategy is a technical indicator used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market. Here's a summary of the strategy:

1. **Definition**: The indicator measures the current close relative to the highest high over a specified period, ranging from 0 to -100. A reading above -20 indicates an overbought condition, while below -80 suggests oversold.

2. **Strategy Rules**:
   - Enter a long position when the indicator crosses below -90.
   - Exit the trade when the indicator crosses above -30 or if the close exceeds yesterday's high.

3. **Backtesting Results**: 
   - The strategy has an annual return of 11.5% over 580 trades, outperforming a Buy and Hold approach (e.g., S&P 500) during periods like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - It operates with only 22% market exposure, reducing risk.

4. **Drawbacks**: The strategy has a moderate maximum drawdown of 177%, so it's essential to consider transaction costs and risks.

5. **Conclusion**: The Williams Percentage R is a simple yet effective tool, particularly during market turmoil, but should be tested with historical data and potentially using fractional shares to manage risk.
