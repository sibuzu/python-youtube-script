The trading strategy discussed focuses on identifying overbought conditions in the stock market using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) as a key indicator. Here's a concise summary of the strategy:

1. **Understanding Overbought and Mean Reversion**: The strategy is based on the principle of mean reversion, where strong deviations from the trend are expected to revert to the average. Overbought conditions occur when the market experiences significant growth over a defined period (e.g., days, weeks, or months).

2. **Using RSI Indicator**: The RSI is used to identify overbought conditions. A two-day RSI above 95 signals that the market is overbought.

3. **Trading Rules**:
   - Buy (entry) the S&P 500 at the close when the two-day RSI is above 95.
   - Sell (exit) at the close after a specified number of days, depending on the strategy's parameters.

4. **Backtesting Results**: Backtests show that returns in the short term (first five days) are lower than the long-term average (~0.05% per day). However, as time progresses, returns tend to align with long-term averages, suggesting mean reversion.

5. **Conclusion**: The strategy highlights that overbought conditions may lead to lower short-term returns but can offer opportunities for longer-term investors due to the expected reversion to the mean.

This approach aims to help traders make informed decisions by leveraging statistical analysis and technical indicators like RSI.
