The trading strategy discussed is based on the Golden Cross indicator, which involves using the 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day moving average to signal a bullish breakout (buy signal) and crossing below it to signal a bearish breakout (sell signal). The strategy aims to minimize losses during bear markets and maximize gains in bull markets. 

Key points from the summary:
1. **Golden Cross Indicator**: 
   - A short-term moving average (50-day) crossing above a long-term moving average (200-day) indicates a bullish trend, prompting a buy.
   - Conversely, if the 50-day crosses below the 200-day, it signals a bearish trend, prompting a sell.

2. **Performance**:
   - Backtested on the S&P 500 from 1960 onwards, resulting in 32 trades held for approximately 350 days each.
   - 78% of trades were winners with an average gain of 15.4% and an annual return of 6.6%.
   - The strategy was only active 69% of the time compared to buy-and-hold, which is active 100% of the time.

3. **Risk-Adjusted Return**:
   - Lower drawdowns (33%) compared to buy-and-hold (56%), leading to a better risk-adjusted return of 9.5%.
   - The strategy aims to reduce losses during bear markets while capitalizing on bull market gains.

4. **Additional Strategy**:
   - Mentioned the short-term NR7 strategy as another system that complements this approach.
