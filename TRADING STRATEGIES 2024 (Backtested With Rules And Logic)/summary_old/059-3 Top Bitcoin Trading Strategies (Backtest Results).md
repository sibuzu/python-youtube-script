The video presents three Bitcoin trading strategies, each based on different principles:

1. **MACD Histogram Strategy**: This strategy uses the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) histogram to generate buy and sell signals. The histogram is calculated as the difference between the MACD line and the signal line. When the histogram turns positive, a buy signal is generated, and when it turns negative, a sell signal is triggered. Backtesting shows that this strategy outperforms a buy-and-hold approach, with an annual return of 77% versus 61%, while being invested only 54% of the time.

2. **25-Day Breakout Strategy**: This momentum-based strategy involves buying Bitcoin when its price breaks above the close from 25 days prior and selling when it breaks below that level. The strategy has a low win rate (around 43%) but still generates solid returns, with an average annual return higher than holding Bitcoin. It keeps traders invested only 56% of the time.

3. **Seasonal Pattern Strategy**: This strategy is based on buying Bitcoin on the fifth-to-last trading day of the month and selling it on the third trading day of the following month. Backtesting indicates strong performance, with an average annual return of nearly 41%, while being invested only 23% of the time. However, recent performance has been flattening.
