The trading strategy discussed is a volatility-based approach that has been in use for nearly a decade. It performs well across various ETFs and Futures contracts, with the best historical performance on the NASDAQ 100. Key features include:

- **Performance**: The strategy delivers consistent returns, averaging around 13% annually, with minimal drawdowns and no significant losses except during the 2008 financial crisis (max drawdown of 18%). It also performs well in both bull and bear markets.

- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Despite being invested only about 11% of the time and holding trades for less than five days on average, the strategy offers a high risk-adjusted return of nearly 120%.

- **Diversification**: While it works across multiple indexes, it excels on NASDAQ 100. It also shows positive results on S&P 500 and Consumer Staples ETF (XLP), though returns may vary.

- **Rules**: The strategy employs three rules for entry: volatility, price action, and trend filtering, with one rule for exit. It is designed to minimize slippage and commissions due to the low number of trades per year.

The strategy is available for a moderate fee, reflecting its perceived value given its performance and the effort required to maintain it.
