The Fabian Timing Model is a quantitative trend-following strategy developed by Richard Fabian in the mid-1960s. It is based on the observation that the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the utility sector tend to move together. Here's a summary of the strategy:

### Trading Rules:
1. **Buy Signal**: 
   - The strategy signals a "buy" for the S&P 500 when all three indices (S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the utility sector) are above their respective 39-week moving averages.

2. **Sell Signal**:
   - It signals a "sell" when two or more of these indices are below their respective 39-week moving averages.

### Backtest Results (from 2000 using SPY ETF):
- The model outperformed a "buy and hold" strategy, generating a 7% return versus 5% for buy-and-hold.
- It was invested only 56% of the time, indicating significant time out of the market.
- The strategy is designed for long-term investing, not short-term gains.

### Key Notes:
- **Long-Term Focus**: The Fabian Timing Model is not intended for quick profits but rather for sustained growth over decades.
- **Patience and Time**: Consistency with the strategy requires patience and time to see positive results.
- **Further Reading**: For more details, consider reading the linked article or exploring additional resources on the website.

This strategy aims to capitalize on long-term trends by staying invested only when conditions are favorable, thereby potentially enhancing investment returns over time.
