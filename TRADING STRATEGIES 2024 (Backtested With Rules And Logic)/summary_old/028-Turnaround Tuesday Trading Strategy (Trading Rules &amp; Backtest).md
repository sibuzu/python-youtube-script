The trading strategy discussed in the video is called the "Turnaround Tuesday" strategy, which is based on a seasonal effect observed in the stock market. Here's a summary of the strategy:

1. **Concept**: The idea is that if the stock market experiences a down day on Monday, there is a higher probability that the market will reverse its trend and rise significantly on Tuesday. Conversely, if the market rises on Monday, it tends to flatten or decline on Tuesday.

2. **Trading Rules**:
   - If today is Monday and the closing price of the current trading day (Monday) is lower than Friday's close, buy at the close.
   - Exit the trade either when the close exceeds the previous day's high (Tuesday's close compared to Monday's high) or hold for a maximum of five days.

3. **Performance**:
   - When tested on SPY (an ETF tracking the S&P 500), the strategy produced an impressive equity curve with relatively small drawdowns.
   - The maximum drawdown was short-lived, and other drawdowns were in single digits.
   - The annualized return of the strategy is 10.6%, which is lower than the 99.8% return from a long-term buy-and-hold strategy on SPY over a period starting in 1993.

4. **Comparison with Buy-and-Hold**:
   - While the Turnaround Tuesday strategy has lower returns, it involves being invested only about 24% of the time, keeping 76% of the capital in cash.
   - This cash can be used for other complementary strategies.

5. **Improvements**:
   - The strategy can be tweaked to improve results, which is available to paying subscribers.

6. **Considerations**:
   - It's important to do thorough research and ensure that this or any strategy aligns with your financial goals.
   - The strategy is not presented as investment advice, and viewers are encouraged to perform their own due diligence.
