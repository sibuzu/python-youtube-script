The trading strategy discussed during Ramadan involves analyzing the stock market performance during this holy month. Here's a summary:

1. **Ramadan Overview**: Ramadan is a significant Muslim holiday that varies each year in the Gregorian calendar. The strategy focuses on countries where Ramadan is widely celebrated, such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt.

2. **Strategy**:
   - If Ramadan starts on a weekend, buy the S&P 500 (or ETFs representing countries celebrating Ramadan) on the following Monday.
   - Sell after the holiday ends.
   - The rationale is to capitalize on potential market movements during this period.

3. **Performance**:
   - In the U.S., the strategy yielded an annual return of approximately 1.1%, slightly better than a "Buy and Hold" approach but not significantly superior.
   - When tested on ETFs from Saudi Arabia (KSA), Egypt (EGPT), and Turkey (2R), the performance was flat over 15 years.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The strategy shows modest returns in the U.S. but lacks strong performance in Muslim countries.
   - It is presented as one of many strategies available on their website, encouraging viewers to explore further.

This strategy may not be highly effective but offers an alternative approach for traders interested in market behavior during specific holidays.
