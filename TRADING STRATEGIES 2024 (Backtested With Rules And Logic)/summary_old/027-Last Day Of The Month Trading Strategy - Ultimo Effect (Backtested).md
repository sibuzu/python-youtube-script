The trading strategy discussed in the video is called the "Turn of the Month" strategy. Here's a summary:

1. **Concept**: The strategy leverages the "end-of-the-month effect," where stocks tend to rally near the end of each month due to factors like salary payments, balance adjustments, and increased savings. This effect typically spills over into the first few days of the new month.

2. **Rules**:
   - Buy the S&P 500 on the close of the fifth trading day of the month.
   - Sell on the close of the third trading day of the following month.

3. **Duration**: The strategy involves holding a position for approximately 7 days each month, freeing up time for other activities.

4. **Performance**:
   - It outperforms the traditional Buy and Hold strategy with an annual return of 7.1% compared to 6.9%, using the same exposure period.
   - Drawdowns are lower; while the Buy and Hold strategy has a maximum drawdown of -56%, the Turn of the Month strategy tops out at -27%.

5. **Flexibility**: The trading rules can be adjusted based on individual experience and market conditions to potentially improve returns.

The video emphasizes that this strategy allows traders to earn consistent monthly profits with minimal time investment, making it an attractive option for those seeking efficiency in their trading activities.
