The trading strategy in question is designed for closed-end funds (CEFs) and focuses on reducing market exposure to minimize drawdowns while aiming for significant returns. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Strategy Overview**: 
   - The strategy uses the daily price-to-NAV ratio of CEFs and applies a 2-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) to determine entry and exit points.
   
2. **Entry and Exit Rules**:
   - Enter a long position when the 2-day RSI of the price-to-NAV ratio crosses below 10, indicating potential undervaluation.
   - Exit the trade when the 2-day RSI crosses above 60, suggesting overvaluation.

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Backtesting with fund ticker EtG resulted in 212 trades, an average gain of 48%, and a time spent in the market at 133% (indicating limited holding periods).
   - Maximum drawdown was 26%, significantly lower than buy-and-hold's 74%.

4. **Objective**:
   - To reduce market exposure by holding positions only when signaled, aiming for higher returns with lower risk compared to a passive approach.

5. **Considerations**:
   - RSI signals may fail in trending markets; strategy specificity to CEFs suggests possible limitations outside this asset class.
   - Backtest results do not guarantee future performance.

In essence, the strategy seeks to capitalize on short-term price discrepancies relative to NAV using momentum indicators, aiming for efficient trading with reduced risk.
