The NR7 trading strategy, developed by Tony Crabbill in 1990, is a volatility-based approach aimed at entering the market during low volatility periods and exiting when volatility increases. Here's a concise summary:

### Key Features:
- **Entry Signal**: Enter long positions at the close of the day when the daily range (High - Low) is the lowest among the previous six trading days.
- **Exit Signal**: Exit the trade at the close if the current day's closing price exceeds the previous day's high.
- **Backtesting Results**: 
  - Tested on SPY ETF from 1993 to present.
  - Starting with $1,000,000, the strategy resulted in:
    - Average gain per trade: ~26%
    - Max drawdown: ~25%
    - Annual return: ~7.6%
- **Comparison**: The annual return is slightly below buy-and-hold (9.7%) but offers better risk-adjusted returns (~20%).
- **Improvement**: Adding a 200-day moving average trend filter reduces max drawdown to ~15% without affecting the average gain.

### Conclusion:
NR7 is an effective strategy for traders seeking to capitalize on low volatility periods with improved risk management.
