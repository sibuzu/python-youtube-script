The trading strategy presented is based on the idea of a "Valentine's Day Rally," which suggests that stock markets exhibit abnormal positive returns leading up to February 14th. Here's a summary of the strategy:

1. **Entry and Exit Rules**:
   - Enter long positions in February when the calendar day is the 10th or later.
   - Exit the trade on February 14th (Valentine's Day) at the market close, or on the first trading day after if February 14th is not a trading day.

2. **Performance**:
   - The strategy shows an upward equity curve in the S&P 500 since 1960.
   - The average gain per trade is approximately 0.35% over about three trading days, which is higher than random three-day periods.
   - Emerging Markets (e.g., ETF EEM) have shown stronger performance, with an average gain of 1.4%.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The strategy suggests that markets, particularly emerging ones, tend to rally around Valentine's Day, potentially offering profitable opportunities for traders.
