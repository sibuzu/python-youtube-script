The trading strategy described is a trend-following approach that uses two moving averages: a 9-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and a 30-period Weighted Moving Average (WMA). Here's a concise summary:

1. **Components**:
   - **9-period EMA**: Represents short-term trends.
   - **30-period WMA**: Represents long-term trends.

2. **Entry Rules**:
   - Buy when the 9-period EMA crosses above the 30-period WMA.
   - Sell when the 9-period EMA crosses below the 30-period WMA.

3. **Backtesting Results**:
   - Average gain per trade: 0.85%.
   - Underperformed compared to a Buy-and-Hold strategy (4.6% vs. 9.2%).
   - Modified backtest with additional rules showed similar performance, with 4.5% annual returns versus 9.2% for Buy-and-Hold.

4. **Risk-Adjusted Return**:
   - Time spent in the market: 60%, suggesting lower risk due to reduced exposure during non-trending periods.
