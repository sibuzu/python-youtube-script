The "Work Trading" strategy is an intriguing approach that relies on making 12 random trades per year, each held for four days. Here's a concise summary of the key points:

1. **Strategy Overview**: The strategy involves selecting 12 trades annually based entirely on chance, without using indicators or analysis. Each trade is held for four days.

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Average Gain per Trade**: Approximately 0.37 (unit unspecified, likely pips or percentage).
   - **Profit Factor**: 1.7, indicating more profits than losses.
   - **Maximum Drawdown**: Around 12%, which is relatively manageable.

3. **Skepticism and Considerations**:
   - The reliance on randomness in trading is unconventional, as typically a systematic approach with analysis is preferred for sustainability.
   - Despite positive metrics, the strategy's long-term viability is questioned due to market efficiency and unpredictability.
   - Risk management practices, such as position sizing, are crucial to avoid significant losses.

4. **Conclusion**: While the strategy shows decent performance metrics, its reliance on randomness raises doubts about its sustainability. It may serve as an experimental approach rather than a reliable long-term method. Further details on trade selection and execution would be essential for a comprehensive assessment.

In essence, while the strategy has some appealing results, caution is advised due to its random nature, and it may be more suitable as a test of unconventional methods rather than a primary trading approach.
