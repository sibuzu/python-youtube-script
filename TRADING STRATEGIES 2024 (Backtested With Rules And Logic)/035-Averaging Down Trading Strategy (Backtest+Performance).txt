[00:01] have you ever bought a stock and watched
[00:02] its price plummet leaving you frustrated
[00:05] if so you're not alone many Traders
[00:07] experience this pain but there's a
[00:09] strategy that can help you turn the
[00:10] tables and potentially profit from
[00:12] falling stock prices it's called the
[00:15] averaging down trading strategy a
[00:17] strategy we've explained on our website
[00:20] in this video we'll show you two trading
[00:22] strategies each with specific trading
[00:24] rules the first one is a regular trading
[00:27] strategy while the second strategy shows
[00:29] how you might improve it by averaging
[00:31] down what do we mean by averaging down
[00:35] it involves buying more shares of a
[00:37] stock as the price declines this may
[00:39] seem counterintuitive but it can
[00:41] actually be a sound decision if done
[00:43] correctly here's how it works imagine
[00:46] you buy a hundred shares of stock at $10
[00:49] per share the price then Falls to $8 per
[00:52] share if you believe the stock is a good
[00:54] investment you could buy another 100
[00:56] shares at the lower price so bring your
[00:59] average cost per share down to $9 per
[01:01] share if the stock then recovers to $10
[01:05] per share you'd have made a profit of
[01:06] 10% on your total investment however
[01:09] when averaging down it's important to
[01:11] understand that it needs to be a
[01:12] rational reason for doing so let's show
[01:15] you two trading strategies to find out
[01:17] how you can average down first we back
[01:20] test a trading strategy that buys when
[01:22] the 5-day RSI drops below 35 and we keep
[01:26] the position until it rises above
[01:28] yesterday's highest price
[01:30] this is a classical mean reversion
[01:32] strategy but the equity curve shows it's
[01:34] performed well on S&P 500 since 1993
[01:38] until today the trading statistics are
[01:41] good but let's turn it into an average
[01:43] down trading strategy we employ 50% of
[01:47] our Capital when the 5-day RSI drops
[01:49] below 50 and we add the remaining 50%
[01:52] when the daily RSI drops at least five
[01:55] points and is still below 50 we use the
[01:58] same cell trigger as in the first
[02:00] strategy in practice we're averaging
[02:03] down our Capital compound slightly less
[02:06] compared to the first strategy but the
[02:07] trading statistics are better on the
[02:10] screen you see the statistics for the
[02:12] averaging down trading strategy on the
[02:14] right side while the overall profits are
[02:17] slightly less the averaging down
[02:19] strategy reduces Max loss and increases
[02:21] the relationship between wins and losses
[02:24] shown by The Profit Factor because the
[02:26] average down strategy only starts with
[02:28] 50% of the Capital the capital spent
[02:31] invested goes down this means that the
[02:34] risk adjusted return is better for the
[02:36] averaging down trading strategy 55%
[02:39] versus
[02:40] 39% at the end of the day it's all about
[02:43] preferences while we'd like to use the
[02:45] average down strategy you might think
[02:47] the opposite we remind you that we have
[02:49] hundreds of other trading strategies on
