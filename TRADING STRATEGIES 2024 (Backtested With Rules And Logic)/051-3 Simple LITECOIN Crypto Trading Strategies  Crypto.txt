[00:13] back-tested strategies for Litecoin and
[00:16] the best part you can easily start using
[00:19] these strategies yourself to turn a
[00:20] profit in the crypto Market
[00:22] first let's briefly mention that
[00:24] Litecoin is a decentralized
[00:26] cryptocurrency that is used for
[00:28] peer-to-peer transactions it was
[00:30] launched in October 2011 and inspired by
[00:33] Bitcoin hence Litecoin was among the
[00:35] earliest altcoins okay let's return to
[00:38] our trading strategies and present our
[00:40] first strategy for today it's a
[00:42] short-term Trend following strategy that
[00:44] has the following trading rules one if
[00:47] the close breaks above the 20-day simple
[00:49] moving average you buy at the close 2.
[00:52] sell at the close if the close breaks
[00:55] below the 20-day simple moving average
[00:57] this simple strategy has outperformed
[00:59] Buy and Hold with a wide margin the
[01:02] equity curve looks like this the 156
[01:05] trades made an average gain of 8.4
[01:07] percent which resulted in an annual
[01:10] return of 114 percent
[01:12] for comparison Buy and Hold returned 40
[01:15] annually that's what we call out
[01:18] performance let's go to our second
[01:19] strategy which is a long-term Trend
[01:22] following strategy the trading rules
[01:24] read like this one construct two simple
[01:27] moving averages one short average of 100
[01:30] days and one long average of 250 days 2.
[01:34] when the short moving average crosses
[01:36] above the long moving average go long at
[01:39] the close three when the short moving
[01:41] average closes below the long moving
[01:43] average sell at the close yet again this
[01:46] simple strategy has outperformed Buy and
[01:49] Hold by a wide margin this is what the
[01:51] equity curve looks like it's only seven
[01:54] trades so the sample size is small but
[01:56] they made an annual return of 66 which
[01:59] is slightly more than Buy and Hold at
[02:01] forty percent annually
[02:03] our third strategy is a momentum
[02:05] strategy and has the following trading
[02:07] rules one if the close is higher than
[02:10] the close 25 days ago go long at the
[02:13] close two if the close is lower than the
[02:16] close 25 days ago sell at the close this
[02:20] strategy has also fared well the equity
[02:23] curve looks like this the 129 trades
[02:26] made an average gain per trade of 9.6
[02:28] percent and the annual returns were 70
[02:31] percent again the strategy outclassed
