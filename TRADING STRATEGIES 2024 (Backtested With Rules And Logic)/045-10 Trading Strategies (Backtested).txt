[00:01] 10 trading
[00:03] strategies this video shows you 10
[00:05] trading strategies where we trade
[00:07] different assets classes you can see the
[00:10] results sliding on your screen so make
[00:12] sure you stick to the
[00:13] end that said we go straight at it and
[00:16] show you the first of the 10 trading
[00:18] strategies the first trading strategy is
[00:21] a seasonal trading strategy it's called
[00:23] the tax day strategy in the US taxpayers
[00:27] need to file before the 15th of April
[00:30] does tax day signal any bullish or
[00:32] bearish trading signal let's find out
[00:35] and back test the S&P
[00:37] 500 the trading rules are simple and we
[00:40] buy at the end of March and we sell on
[00:42] the first trading day after tax day that
[00:45] means we hold the position for about 2
[00:47] weeks it shows a pretty steady and
[00:50] consistent growth in the equity since
[00:52] 1960 and the average gain is
[00:56] 1.06% which is three times better than
[00:58] any random period
[01:00] seasonal trading patterns are frequent
[01:02] not only for stocks and we've covered
[01:04] plenty of them for free on our website
[01:07] let's go to our second of the 10 trading
[01:09] strategies in trading when you sell is
[01:12] just as important as when you buy but
[01:15] still most Traders focus on when to buy
[01:18] we'll now show you a sell signal we've
[01:20] used in the stock market for almost two
[01:23] decades to show you its efficiency we
[01:26] make a pretty standard strategy where we
[01:28] buy NASDAQ 100 when the 2-day RSI
[01:31] indicator drops below 10 and we sell
[01:34] when it reaches
[01:35] 70 this simple trading strategy has been
[01:38] decent but suffers from many large draw
[01:41] Downs let's change the cell trigger to a
[01:44] day where the close ends higher than
[01:46] yesterday's high you reduce draw downs
[01:49] and you also increase profits
[01:51] substantially this sell signal is proven
[01:53] to work well for stocks for almost four
[01:55] decades since Futures Trading started in
[01:58] the
[01:58] 1980s
[02:00] the returns with the new cell signal
[02:02] made the strategy outperform by and hold
[02:04] since the year
[02:05] 2000 let's use the same sell signal for
[02:08] our next and third trading strategy
[02:11] where we use the Candlestick pattern
[02:12] called dark cloud cover as Buy Signal
[02:16] the trading rules for all candlesticks
[02:18] are demanding but we Quantified dark
[02:20] cloud cover into the trading rules you
[02:21] see on the
[02:23] screen as mentioned we sell when the
[02:25] close ends higher than yesterday's high
[02:29] when we back test the ETF the tracks S&P
[02:31] 500 spy we get a decent Equity
[02:35] curve it's not that many trades but
[02:38] remember this is just one of many
[02:40] Candlestick patterns for example if we
[02:42] use the 10 best Candlestick patterns we
[02:46] get the equity curve you see on the
[02:47] screen which is annual returns of 10%
[02:50] despite being invested only onethird of
[02:53] the time we give you a friendly reminder
[02:56] that you find the trading rules and code
[02:58] for all 75 candlesticks on our
[03:01] website let's jump to strategy four of
[03:04] the 10 trading strategies this strategy
[03:06] trades NASDAQ 100 and long-term treasury
[03:09] bonds from the long side and we use the
[03:12] ticker codes QQQ and
[03:15] TLT we include interest rates because
[03:17] the growth stocks on NASDAQ are
[03:19] sensitive to
[03:20] rates the trading rules are on the
[03:23] screen and they're probably the most
[03:24] complex of all the 10 trading strategies
[03:27] in this video the capital grows from
[03:30] 100,000 to 1.2 million in 20 years and
[03:34] draw Downs are small and
[03:36] short-lived draw Downs are over 20% only
[03:39] twice over the period despite being
[03:41] invested 58% of the time Max draw down
[03:44] for buying and holding NASDAQ 100 was
[03:46] over 55% so this is a huge
[03:50] Improvement you make almost 1% per trade
[03:53] but the average trade is rather long
[03:55] compared to all other trading strategies
[03:57] in this
[03:58] video Let's stick to using interest
[04:00] rates as a variable for one more trading
[04:03] strategy today's fifth this time we use
[04:06] the yield of 10-year treasury bonds as a
[04:09] filter for when to own S&P 500 from 1960
[04:13] until today the trading rules are simple
[04:16] we own S&P 500 only when the yield is
[04:19] below its 15-day exponential moving
[04:21] average and we stay out of the market
[04:24] when it's above the equity growth is not
[04:27] linear and you didn't avoid the 10year
[04:29] sideway waves movement after the dotom
[04:31] bubble burst in the year 2000 however
[04:34] you reduce the Max draw down
[04:35] significantly and you get the same
[04:37] return as Buy and Hold despite being
[04:39] invested only about 50% of the time if
[04:43] we flip the trading rules we get the
[04:45] equity curve on the screen thus all
[04:47] gains since 1960 have come when yields
[04:50] are falling or are low which is pretty
[04:52] intuitive what happens if we change the
[04:55] number of days in the exponential moving
[04:57] average the First Column shows the
[04:59] number of of days in the exponential
[05:00] moving average and the three last
[05:02] columns show average gain per trade
[05:05] annual returns and Max draw down it's
[05:09] pretty clear that all gains in stocks
[05:11] come when the interest rates are falling
[05:12] or are
[05:14] low let's go to our sixth trading
[05:16] strategy which is an end of Monon
[05:18] trading strategy for Russell
[05:20] 2000 we buy on the last fifth trading
[05:23] day of the month and we hold the
[05:25] position until the end of the first
[05:27] trading day of the new month the capital
[05:30] grows consistently since
[05:32] 1987 but the performance is weaker after
[05:34] 2010 but still
[05:36] positive for the cash index which
[05:38] doesn't include reinvested dividends the
[05:41] performance is better than Buy and Hold
[05:43] despite being invested only 28% of the
[05:46] time our seventh trading strategy is a
[05:49] seasonal short strategy we short the
[05:52] specific week that's historically the
[05:53] worst week of the year for the stock
[05:55] market and it happens in the second half
[05:57] of September the notorious bad month for
[06:00] stocks the strategy is very simple go
[06:03] short S&P 500 on the third Friday in
[06:06] September and cover one week later since
[06:10] 1960 short has worked amazingly well
[06:13] with an average gain of
[06:14] 0.9% short trading strategies are hard
[06:17] to find because of the long-term gains
[06:19] in stocks so this seasonal short
[06:22] strategy might fit in a portfolio of
[06:24] trading
[06:25] strategies the eighth trading strategy
[06:27] is about Bitcoin it's a momentum
[06:29] strategy and yet again the trading rules
[06:32] are simple we go long when Bitcoin
[06:34] breaks above the close 25 days ago and
[06:37] we sell when it breaks below the close
[06:39] 25 days
[06:41] ago Bitcoin has had boom and bus Cycles
[06:44] but this momentum strategy has so far
[06:46] managed to avoid most of the brutal draw
[06:48] Downs worth noting is the low win rate
[06:51] at 42% despite this the annual return is
[06:54] significantly better than Buy and Hold
[06:57] 86% versus 60%
[07:00] because most Traders don't like to lose
[07:02] it's mentally challenging to trade a
[07:03] strategy with a low win rate what
[07:06] happens if we change the lookback period
[07:09] the table shows that the performance has
[07:11] been solid for a wide range of lookback
[07:13] periods but the best results are between
[07:15] 20 to 40
[07:17] days the second to last of our 10
[07:19] trading strategies is the Santa Claus
[07:22] rally in stocks it turns out that Santa
[07:24] comes early to the stock market we buy
[07:27] S&P 500 on the first Friday after
[07:30] calendar day 14 in December and we sell
[07:33] on the third trading day of the new year
[07:36] the Santa Claus season has been pretty
[07:38] consistent with almost linear growth
[07:39] since
[07:41] 1960 the average gain is 1.34% but
[07:44] you're invested only 4% of the time of
[07:46] the year if we divide the annual return
[07:49] by the time invested which is 1.28%
[07:52] divided by
[07:54] .4% we get a risk adjusted return of
[07:57] over
[07:58] 30% thus the return during the Christmas
[08:00] holiday is many times better than any
[08:02] random period the last of the 10 trading
[08:06] strategies uses our favorite trading
[08:08] indicator for stocks the indicator is
[08:10] called Williams percentage R despite its
[08:13] rather peculiar name it's proven to work
[08:16] well for stocks for over three decades
[08:18] the trading rules are simple and this is
[08:21] a typical mean reversion strategy Buy on
[08:23] weakness and sell on strength when we
[08:26] back test the trading rules on NASDAQ
[08:28] 100 using the ETF with the ticker code
[08:31] QQQ history tells us that this has so
[08:34] far been a solid trading strategy
[08:37] 100,000 has grown to 1.7 million and the
[08:40] three bare markets along the way didn't
[08:42] ruin the
[08:43] strategy annual returns are better than
[08:45] Buy and Hold however slippage and
[08:48] commissions are not included but they're
[08:50] very low for liquid assets such as
[08:52] QQQ the returns per year shows that the
[08:55] strategy has performed well during bare
[08:57] markets but that is of course not
[08:59] guaranteed to happen in the
[09:01] future remember this is not investment
[09:04] advice but meant to help you get trading
[09:06] ideas please do your own research and
[09:09] good luck
