[00:01] inverted yield curve trading strategy
[00:04] can an inverted yield curve be used as a
[00:06] successful stock market indicator can we
[00:08] make a profitable inverted yield curve
[00:10] trading
[00:11] strategy we'll show you but before we
[00:14] make trading rules and show you the
[00:15] results let's explain what an inverted
[00:18] yield curve is a normal yield curve is
[00:21] one in which longer maturity bonds offer
[00:23] a greater yield than shorter maturity
[00:25] bonds due to the risks involved with
[00:28] time this makes sense is you would
[00:30] require a higher return the longer to
[00:32] maturity to compensate for the increased
[00:35] risk however there are times when
[00:37] shorter term bonds have higher yields
[00:39] than longer term bonds and the yield
[00:41] curve becomes
[00:43] inverted for example the 2-year yield
[00:45] can be 4% while the 10-year yield is
[00:48] 3.5% it's inverted historically there's
[00:51] not been many inverted yield curves on
[00:54] the screen you can see the 10-year yield
[00:56] deducted the 2-year yield when it's
[00:59] negative we we have an inverted yield
[01:01] curve the yield curve has inverted 44
[01:04] times since 1976 but it tends to be
[01:07] clustered in smalltime Windows can we
[01:10] make money on yield
[01:11] inversions let's back test a couple of
[01:13] inverted yield curve trading
[01:16] strategies our first inverted yield
[01:18] curve trading strategy buys when the
[01:20] curve gets inverted and sells 250
[01:23] trading days later since 1976 the
[01:27] strategy returned an average 7.3% over
[01:30] the next 250 days which is more or less
[01:32] the same as the typical annual
[01:35] return let's go to inverted yield curve
[01:37] trading strategy number
[01:39] two the trading rules are based on mean
[01:42] reversion of the yield curve and we
[01:44] employ the RSI
[01:46] indicator there are only 102 trades
[01:49] since
[01:50] 1976 the average gain is 2.5% and you're
[01:53] invested almost 3 months per trade the
[01:56] return is slightly better than any
[01:58] random period
[02:00] all in all our Research indicates the
[02:02] inverted yield curve trading strategy is
[02:04] not particularly
[02:06] useful good luck
