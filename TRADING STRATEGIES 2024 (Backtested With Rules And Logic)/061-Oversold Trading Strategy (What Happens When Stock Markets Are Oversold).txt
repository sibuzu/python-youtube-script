[00:00] what happens when stock markets are
[00:01] oversold unlocking the secret to stock
[00:04] market success requires an understanding
[00:06] of the concept of oversold in this video
[00:08] we will show you why you must understand
[00:10] this concept what it means and what kind
[00:13] of return can you expect when the stock
[00:14] market is considered oversold stay tuned
[00:17] and we'll answer all in this video
[00:19] before we start we remind you that you
[00:21] find our best strategies on our webpage
[00:23] we share tips and tricks for both
[00:25] trading and investing first to navigate
[00:28] the Market's complexities you must grasp
[00:30] the principle of mean reversion the main
[00:32] principle to understand the term
[00:34] overbought in statistical terms this
[00:37] means that strong deviations from the
[00:39] trend will eventually revert to the mean
[00:41] and move in the opposite direction so
[00:43] what exactly is oversold it's when the
[00:45] market has experienced a week period
[00:47] with falling prices which could be days
[00:49] weeks or months the exact duration is up
[00:51] to you but it's crucial to have a clear
[00:53] definition if you use a daily time frame
[00:56] in trading for instance a period of five
[00:57] days could be considered oversold
[00:59] depending on how much the stock market
[01:01] fell during that time at Quantified
[01:03] strategies we like to rely on numbers to
[01:05] illustrate our points therefore we will
[01:07] use the RSI indicator to prove our Point
[01:09] by formulating a trading strategy to
[01:11] identify oversold conditions hopefully
[01:14] with this knowledge you can make better
[01:15] decisions and Achieve improved returns
[01:17] in the market let's find out what
[01:19] happens when the stock market is
[01:21] oversold we back test we make the
[01:23] following trading rules one we buy S P
[01:26] 500 at the close when the three-day RSI
[01:29] is below 20. two we sell at the close
[01:32] after end days this is a simple strategy
[01:34] but we make it simple to prove our point
[01:36] the relative strength indicator RSI is
[01:39] used because it goes from oversold to
[01:41] overbought conditions constantly and it
[01:43] measures the velocity of those moves
[01:45] when values are low it indicates a
[01:47] depressed Market our back test is
[01:49] summarized in this table the First
[01:51] Column shows when we exit Row one is
[01:53] exiting after one day row after two days
[01:56] and so on column three shows that the
[01:58] returns in from the second day in onward
[02:00] are high higher than any random period
[02:02] which is about 0.04 percent per day
[02:05] however as time goes on the returns
[02:07] gravitate toward the long-term averages
[02:09] as expected let's make a back test with
[02:12] the following trading rules we buy at
[02:14] the close when the three-day RSI is
[02:16] below 20 and we sell when the close is
[02:18] higher than yesterday's high let's look
[02:20] at the results the equity growth shows a
[02:22] steady upward growth and our Equity
[02:24] grows from one hundred zero zero zero to
[02:27] 1.3 million During the period not bad
[02:30] for such a simple strategy even better
[02:32] the drawdowns are small as indicated in
[02:34] the lower pane the annual return is 9.14
[02:37] percent even though we are invested just
[02:40] 16.8 percent of the time thus the
[02:42] risk-adjusted return is 54 we find
[02:46] risk-adjusted return by dividing 9.14 by
[02:50] 0.1681 which is time spent in the market
[02:53] so to conclude our back Test shows that
[02:56] we can expect higher returns in the
[02:58] short term than any random day when we
[03:00] have an oversold condition that's all
[03:02] for today thanks for tuning in and we'll
[03:04] see you in the next one and by the way
