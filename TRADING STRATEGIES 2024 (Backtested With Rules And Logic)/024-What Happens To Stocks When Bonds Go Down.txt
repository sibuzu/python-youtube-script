[00:00] what happens to stocks when bonds go
[00:02] down in this video we'll show you a
[00:04] proven and back-tested strategy based on
[00:06] the relationship between bonds and
[00:07] stocks you'll find out what happens to
[00:09] stocks when bonds go down however before
[00:12] we dive into the details of this
[00:13] back-tested approach let's first explore
[00:15] why it's crucial for stock investors to
[00:17] keep a close eye on the bond market
[00:19] Financial Theory revolves around the
[00:21] relationship between stocks and interest
[00:23] rates because interest rates determine
[00:25] the value of stocks High interest rates
[00:27] discourage investors from owning risky
[00:29] assets like stocks unless they are
[00:31] adequately compensated for taking on
[00:33] that risk conversely when interest rates
[00:36] decline it becomes more attractive to
[00:38] own riskier assets like stocks gold and
[00:41] Bitcoin let's take a quick look at bonds
[00:43] a bond pays the same coupon annually
[00:46] until it matures for example a bond with
[00:48] a five percent coupon pays five percent
[00:50] each year until it matures which could
[00:52] be 20 years or more however during the
[00:55] Bond's life interest rates fluctuate
[00:57] significantly if interest rates decrease
[00:59] the 5 percent coupon becomes more
[01:01] attractive and investors bid up the
[01:03] bonds price to reflect the falling rates
[01:05] as a result stocks and interest rates
[01:07] have an inverse relationship it's worth
[01:10] noting that stocks are riskier than
[01:11] bonds this is because if a company goes
[01:14] bankrupt bondholders receive their money
[01:16] back before Equity holders therefore
[01:18] bonds are less risky than stocks our
[01:21] hypothesis is that a falling bond market
[01:23] is not good for stocks because interest
[01:25] rates rise which makes it less
[01:27] attractive to own stocks let's back test
[01:29] what happens to stocks when bonds go
[01:31] down we are long stocks spy when bonds
[01:34] TLT are below the end-day moving average
[01:36] and we sell when it's above the end day
[01:39] moving average for example when TLT
[01:41] crosses below its 15-day moving average
[01:43] we buy spy at the close when the close
[01:46] of TLT crosses above its 15-day moving
[01:49] average we sell spy and are out of the
[01:50] market until TLT later crosses below its
[01:53] 15-day moving average what are spy and
[01:55] TLT spy is the ETF that tracks the S P
[01:58] 500 and TL T is the ETF that tracks U.S
[02:02] 20-year treasury bonds when TLT goes up
[02:04] in price the interest rates go down and
[02:06] vice versa to conduct our back testing
[02:08] We performed an optimization test that
[02:10] involved analyzing a range of moving
[02:12] averages from five days up to 100 days
[02:14] in intervals of five days this resulted
[02:17] in a total of 20 back tests here are the
[02:19] results the First Column displays the
[02:22] number of days in the moving average
[02:23] while the subsequent columns show the
[02:25] trading outcomes for each specific
[02:27] number of days in the moving average the
[02:29] third column is particularly significant
[02:31] as it indicates the average gain per
[02:33] trade notably the average is listed in
[02:36] column 3 were lower for all rows
[02:38] compared to any random day let's look at
[02:40] a specific back test we chose the 15-day
[02:43] moving average this is what the equity
[02:45] curve looks like from 2003 as you can
[02:47] see spy's performance is weak spy
[02:49] increased 9.8 percent annually in this
[02:51] period and our strategy returned less
[02:53] than one percent annually in our
[02:55] analysis we conducted 355 trades with an
[02:57] average gain of zero to row 16 percent
[02:59] per trade an annual return of 0.86
[03:02] percent and a maximum drawdown of 50
[03:04] percent so we can conclude that we
[03:06] hardly make money in stocks when bonds
[03:08] go down interestingly when we reverse
[03:10] the buy and sell signals we observed
[03:12] much better results however we'll delve
[03:15] into that further in our next video
[03:16] where we explore the effects of rising
[03:18] Bond markets on stocks stay tuned we
