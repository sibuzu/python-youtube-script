   - Buy additional shares at lower prices to reduce the average cost per share.

     - Buy 100 shares at $10 each.
     - Price drops to $8; buy another 100 shares.
     - Average cost per share becomes $9.

   - Use a rationale (e.g., technical indicators like RSI) to decide when to average down.
   -在示例策略中：
     - Enter when 5-day RSI drops below 50.
     - Add to position if daily RSI falls at least 5 points and remains below 50.

4. **风险管理：**   
   - Allocate 50% of capital initially, with the option to add the remaining 50% under specific conditions.
   - Reduces maximum loss exposure compared to a standard strategy.

   - Averaging down can be controversial due to increased exposure, but it may enhance risk-adjusted performance.
   -策略自定义和回测至关重要。
