[00:00] what happens to stocks when bonds go up
[00:03] welcome to this YouTube video where we
[00:05] reveal a proven and back-tested strategy
[00:07] that's based on the fascinating
[00:09] relationship between bonds and stocks
[00:12] you'll discover the impact of bond
[00:13] market fluctuations on stock Investments
[00:16] and how you can benefit from it but
[00:18] before we delve into the nitty-gritty of
[00:20] this approach let's understand why
[00:22] keeping a close eye on the bond market
[00:24] is crucial for every stock investor out
[00:26] there
[00:27] Financial Theory highlights the
[00:29] importance of bonds because interest
[00:30] rates directly impact the value of
[00:33] stocks when interest rates are low
[00:35] investors are incentivized to invest in
[00:37] riskier assets like stocks since they
[00:40] receive higher returns for taking on
[00:42] that risk however as interest rates rise
[00:45] the appeal of riskier assets like stocks
[00:47] gold and Bitcoin declines now let's take
[00:51] a closer look at bonds
[00:52] a bond pays a fixed coupon annually
[00:55] until it matures meaning that a bond
[00:57] with a five percent coupon will pay five
[00:59] percent each year until its maturity
[01:01] date which could be as long as 20 years
[01:03] or more
[01:04] however during the Bond's lifetime
[01:06] interest rates fluctuate significantly
[01:09] if interest rates increase the Bond's
[01:12] fixed coupon becomes less attractive
[01:14] causing its price to decrease to reflect
[01:16] the increased rates as a result there
[01:19] exists an inverse relationship between
[01:21] stocks and interest rates it's important
[01:23] to note that stocks are generally
[01:25] considered riskier than bonds because
[01:27] bondholders receive their money back
[01:29] before Equity holders in the event of a
[01:31] company's bankruptcy therefore bonds are
[01:34] perceived as less risky than stocks our
[01:36] hypothesis is that a rising bond market
[01:39] is beneficial for stocks since interest
[01:41] rates decrease making stocks more
[01:43] attractive are we correct let's find out
[01:46] let's back test what happens to stocks
[01:49] when bonds go up we are long stocks spy
[01:52] when bonds TLT are above the end-day
[01:54] moving average and we sell when it's
[01:56] below the end-day moving average for
[01:59] example when TLT crosses above its
[02:01] 15-day moving average we buy spy at the
[02:04] close when the close of TLT crosses
[02:07] below its 15-day moving average we sell
[02:09] spy and are out of the market until TLT
[02:12] later crosses above its 15-day moving
[02:14] average
[02:15] what are spy and TLT spy is the ETF that
[02:19] tracks the S P 500 and TLT is the ETF
[02:22] that tracks U.S 20-year treasury bonds
[02:25] when TLT goes down in price the interest
[02:28] rates go up and vice versa we're excited
[02:30] to share with you the results of our
[02:32] back testing our optimization test
[02:34] involved analyzing a range of moving
[02:36] averages from 5 days to 100 days in
[02:39] five-day intervals resulting in a total
[02:42] of 20 back tests and here's what we
[02:44] found the First Column indicates the
[02:46] number of days in the moving average and
[02:49] the subsequent columns show the trading
[02:50] outcomes for each specific number of
[02:52] days but what's really significant is
[02:55] the third column which displays the
[02:57] average gain per trade what's
[03:00] interesting to note is that the average
[03:01] is listed in column 3 were consistently
[03:04] higher across all rows than any random
[03:07] period this means that almost all of the
[03:10] gains in S P 500 came when TLT was above
[03:14] its average
[03:15] we're thrilled to share these findings
[03:17] with you and we hope this information
[03:18] helps you make more informed decisions
[03:20] when it comes to your Investments now
[03:23] let's look at a specific back test we
[03:26] chose the 15-day moving average this is
[03:28] how the equity curve looks like from
[03:31] 2003. as you can see spy's performance
[03:34] is strong Spy increased 9.8 percent
[03:37] annually in this period and our strategy
[03:39] returned slightly less at 8.85 annually
[03:43] despite being invested just 54 percent
[03:45] of the time
[03:47] in our analysis we conducted 365 trades
[03:50] with an average gain of 0.51 per trade
[03:54] an annual return of 8.85 percent and a
[03:58] maximum drawdown of 31 percent so we can
[04:01] conclude that stocks go up when bonds go
[04:03] up obviously when we reverse the buy and
[04:06] sell signals we observe much worse
[04:08] results however we've covered that in
[04:10] another video called what happens to
[04:12] stocks when bonds go down stay tuned we
[04:15] stop here for today and hope you like
