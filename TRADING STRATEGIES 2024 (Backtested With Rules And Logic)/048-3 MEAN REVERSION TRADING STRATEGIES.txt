[00:00] in this video we will be presenting
[00:02] three mean reversion trading strategies
[00:04] that could help take your trading game
[00:06] to the next level
[00:07] these strategies were published on our
[00:09] website many years back and now we're
[00:11] presenting their performance on
[00:13] different ETFs after seeing the videos
[00:16] you'll have three great trading ideas
[00:18] you can test for yourself
[00:20] we'll also discuss why to mean reversion
[00:22] works and which markets are best suited
[00:24] for mean reversion trading strategies
[00:26] and if that's not enough we'll also take
[00:29] you through some historical back testing
[00:31] to give you a sense of the potential
[00:33] performance of these strategies so get
[00:36] ready to learn about a new approach to
[00:37] trading and let's get started
[00:39] first let's briefly Define mean
[00:42] reversion the basic premise behind mean
[00:44] reversion trading is that when a
[00:46] financial assets price deviates
[00:48] significantly from its average price it
[00:50] is likely to eventually revert to its
[00:52] mean price as can be seen in the chart
[00:55] an example of mean reversion is when you
[00:58] buy oversold assets and sell overbought
[01:00] Assets in this video we quantify
[01:03] conditions and make trading rules based
[01:05] on this simple principle is mean
[01:07] reversion a good strategy yes for most
[01:10] Global stock markets mean reversion has
[01:12] worked very well over the last decades
[01:13] however it's not as good for other asset
[01:16] classes why does mean reversion work
[01:18] it's hard to tell but we believe program
[01:20] trading is a major reason why it seems
[01:23] to work
[01:24] let's go straight to our first mean
[01:26] reversion trading strategy the strategy
[01:28] was first published on our website in
[01:30] 2013 and trades the ETF that tracks the
[01:33] consumer staples sector the ticker code
[01:36] is xlp and you can see the specific
[01:38] trading rules on the screen the main
[01:40] idea is to buy after a drop in the
[01:42] market and sell on strength one hundred
[01:45] zero zero zero invested at Inception and
[01:48] compounded until today has performed
[01:50] well
[01:51] the 457 trades returned 0.38 per trade
[01:55] and annual returns of 6.7 percent this
[01:59] is a good result compared to buy and
[02:01] holds is 6.8 percent despite being
[02:04] invested only 28 of the time the
[02:06] risk-adjusted return is 23.6 percent
[02:09] let's go to our second mean reversion
[02:12] strategy of the day this is a short
[02:14] strategy And Trades the Chinese markets
[02:16] we use the very liquid ETF with the
[02:19] ticker code fxi for the back test it has
[02:22] shown strong mean reversion Tendencies
[02:24] over the last decade and the trading
[02:26] rules have worked pretty well over the
[02:28] last 15 years the strategy didn't work
[02:31] prior to 2008 but please also take into
[02:34] consideration that this is a short
[02:36] strategy short is much more difficult to
[02:38] trade than long because of the upward
[02:40] bias in the stock market
[02:42] the trading statistics and performance
[02:44] are good we beat Buy and Hold by a wide
[02:47] margin
[02:48] even better this strategy should offer
[02:51] good diversification to any long
[02:52] strategies you might have
[02:54] what is the best mean reversion
[02:56] indicator this strategy uses the IBS
[02:59] indicator an indicator we have made a
[03:01] separate video of
[03:03] formula is on the screen we consider the
[03:05] IBS relative strength index and the
[03:08] Williams percent r as the best mean
[03:10] reversion indicators let's go to our
[03:13] third and final strategy of the day
[03:15] at this stage you might be wondering
[03:17] what is the best time frame for mean
[03:19] reversion in all our strategies we use
[03:22] the daily time frame because our back
[03:24] tests show that this is the best time
[03:25] frame the third strategy was published
[03:28] on our website in 2012 and it trades S P
[03:31] 500 we use the ETF with the ticker code
[03:34] spy for our back test which has trading
[03:37] rules which can hardly get any simpler
[03:39] we buy on a five-day low and sell when
[03:41] the close is higher than yesterday's
[03:43] high or after five trading days
[03:46] this long strategy has performed well
[03:49] one hundred zero zero zero compounded
[03:51] from 1993 until today has produced 8.8
[03:55] annual returns compared to buy and holds
[03:58] 9.5 percent
[04:00] again we need to consider that the
[04:02] strategy is spending most of the time on
[04:04] the sidelines and thus reducing risk we
[04:07] have managed almost the same return as
[04:09] Buy and Hold despite being invested only
[04:11] 19 percent
[04:12] now that we have presented you with
[04:14] three strategies you are perhaps
[04:16] wondering when mean reversion works best
[04:18] believe it or not our back tests reveal
[04:21] that means reversion works best during a
[04:23] bear Market it might sound
[04:24] counter-intuitive but the reason is
[04:27] increased volatility and perhaps even
[04:29] more counter-intuitive is that long
[04:31] works better than short
[04:33] however the accuracy of any mean
[04:35] reversion strategy depends on the
[04:37] trading rules despite this we can't
[04:40] argue that mean reversion is better than
[04:42] Trend following strategies for example
[04:44] however it seems mean reversion is the
[04:47] low-hanging fruit in the stock market
[04:48] that's all for today if you want the
