[00:01] different order types can result in
[00:03] vastly different outcomes which is why
[00:05] it's important to understand the type of
[00:07] order you use in this video we show you
[00:10] how to turn a market order into a limit
[00:12] order trading strategy you can see the
[00:15] results of our limit order trading
[00:17] strategies on the screen so please make
[00:19] sure you stay until the end what is a
[00:22] limit order trading strategy a limit
[00:24] order trading strategy is in order to
[00:27] buy or sell a security at a specific
[00:29] price or better
[00:30] it comes with a specification of the
[00:32] maximum price to be paid or the minimum
[00:34] price to be received this is why it's
[00:37] called a limit price let's go on to back
[00:40] test two trading strategies to show you
[00:42] the difference between a market order
[00:44] and a limit order trading
[00:46] strategy we start with a basic mean
[00:48] reversion strategy that buys with a
[00:50] market order at the close when we back
[00:54] test the trading strategy on NASDAQ 100
[00:56] it performs well the average gain per
[00:59] trade is 89% which equals 10.4%
[01:02] compounded annually the strategy is
[01:05] invested only 18% and thus the capital
[01:08] is idle for long periods of time for
[01:11] example AC crewing interest mean
[01:13] reversion is a type of strategy that's
[01:15] optimal for limit orders because you buy
[01:18] on weakness and sell on strength with
[01:21] that in mind let's use the same strategy
[01:23] but use a limit price for the buy order
[01:26] we change the trading rules to buy the
[01:28] day after the signal if today's open is
[01:31] lower than yesterday's close as expected
[01:33] the number of Trades dropped
[01:35] significantly more than half the average
[01:38] gain per trade goes up from 89% to
[01:41] 1.12% but this is not enough to offset
[01:44] the lost profits because of the limit
[01:46] order and that you enter the next day
[01:49] annual returns drop to 7.6% from
[01:53] 10.4% Trading is always about different
[01:55] trade-offs this is one of them by using
[01:58] a limit order you miss many profitable
[02:00] trades but the average gain per trade
[02:02] might go
[02:04] up can the strategy be improved or made
[02:06] different if you have any suggestions
[02:09] please comment good luck
[02:13] Trading
