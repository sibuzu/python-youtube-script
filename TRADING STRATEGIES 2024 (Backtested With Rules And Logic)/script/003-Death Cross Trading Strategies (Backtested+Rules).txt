[00:02] death cross trading strategy
[00:04] we'll provide you with examples of death
[00:06] crossers and the historical significance
[00:08] of the death cross indicator strategy
[00:12] how does the death cross indicator work
[00:14] the death cross is a technical indicator
[00:16] that strikes fear into the hearts of
[00:18] Traders and for good reason it turns out
[00:21] stick until the end if you want to find
[00:23] out how much damage a death cross makes
[00:25] it's accurate to pinpoint when you don't
[00:28] get poor results by being invested in
[00:30] stocks in this video we'll be exploring
[00:33] what the death cross trading strategy
[00:34] actually is how it works some death
[00:37] cross examples and most importantly why
[00:40] it signals a kiss of death for equities
[00:43] while it doesn't signal a bearish market
[00:46] it shows that you get poor returns after
[00:48] a death cross so sit tight and get ready
[00:50] to learn all about the death cross and
[00:53] how to avoid getting caught in its
[00:54] deadly grip
[00:56] let's start with explaining what a death
[00:58] cross is how to calculate it and how you
[01:01] can identify this bearish indicator
[01:04] a death cross involves two moving
[01:06] averages one short and one long
[01:09] when the short moving average crosses
[01:11] below the long one a death cross is
[01:13] formed
[01:14] which time frame is used for the death
[01:16] cross and is it a lagging or leading
[01:18] indicator
[01:19] we only use daily bars for the death
[01:22] cross normally the 50 and 200-day moving
[01:25] averages the death cross is a lagging
[01:27] indicator meaning it reacts to events
[01:29] after the price action has taken place
[01:31] thus when the 50-day moving average the
[01:35] red line breaks below the 200-day moving
[01:37] average the Blue Line a death cross is
[01:40] formed
[01:41] let's move more systematically into the
[01:43] death cross moving averages and back
[01:45] test to see how accurate the trading
[01:47] strategy and indicator is
[01:50] so how well does it perform in a back
[01:52] test
[01:53] when we put in the trading rules in our
[01:55] platform we get the following Equity
[01:57] curve since 1960 for the death cross
[01:59] pattern
[02:01] okay so what are the implications of a
[02:03] death cross indicator for the stock
[02:04] market and how long does a death cross
[02:07] typically last
[02:09] the performance is flat indicating you
[02:11] had made almost no money since 1960 even
[02:14] though you're invested 30 percent of the
[02:16] time and stocks have compounded at 10
[02:19] annually
[02:21] can we determine now if the death cross
[02:23] can predict market downturns and how
[02:25] often does the death cross occur
[02:27] there have only been 32 death crosses
[02:30] since 1960 but it proves that a death
[02:32] cross is a temporary kiss of death for
[02:35] equities which means it's a bad time for
[02:37] stocks
[02:38] what are the limitations of the death
[02:40] cross indicator
[02:42] the drawback of a death cross indicator
[02:44] strategy is that it's not a sure thing
[02:46] and you might want to be careful of
[02:48] staying outside the stock market for a
[02:50] long time because of the long-term
[02:52] positive trend
[02:53] is the death cross indicator more
[02:56] effective in specific markets
[02:58] you might wonder if the death cross
[02:59] strategy can be applied to other asset
[03:01] classes such as stocks ETFs
[03:03] cryptocurrencies Bitcoin cfds Forex or
[03:07] Futures and the answer is yes however
[03:10] you need to back test each asset first
[03:14] are there other indicators that
[03:15] complement a death cross
[03:17] not really the death cross is simple but
[03:20] we've backtested other ideas and we've
[03:22] not managed to improve it in trading
[03:25] doing it simple is most of the time the
[03:27] best thing to do
[03:28] some readers might also wonder what the
[03:30] historical success rate is for the death
[03:32] cross indicator
[03:34] despite being a signal of weak future
[03:36] performance until the 50-day moving
[03:38] average crosses the 200-day moving
[03:40] average the success rate or win rate if
[03:43] you like is pretty high at 75 percent
[03:46] but this shows that success rate is not
[03:49] really that relevant what matters is the
[03:51] average gain per trade not success rate
[03:54] the opposite of the death cross is the
[03:56] golden cross a topic we've covered in
[03:58] the next video coming up right after
[03:59] this one
