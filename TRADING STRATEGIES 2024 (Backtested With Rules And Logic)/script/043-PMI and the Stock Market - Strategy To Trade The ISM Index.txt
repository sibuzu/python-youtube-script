[00:00] in this video we back test how low and
[00:02] high ISM Manufacturing Index PMI
[00:05] readings influence the stock market
[00:07] stay until the end and I'll give you my
[00:09] personal opinion about this test
[00:12] the ISM Manufacturing Index or PMI is an
[00:15] important indicator of the health of the
[00:17] U.S manufacturing sector the index is
[00:20] based on surveys and is published once a
[00:22] month
[00:22] a reading above 50 indicates that the
[00:25] manufacturing sector is expanding while
[00:27] a reading below 50 indicates that it's
[00:29] Contracting we back test the following
[00:32] when the readings are above 50 we buy
[00:34] the open of the month S P 500 we sell at
[00:38] the open the next month thus holding for
[00:40] one month the equity curve looks like
[00:42] this the strategy is invested 72 percent
[00:45] of the time and the annual return is 7.3
[00:48] percent compared to 8.5 percent for s p
[00:50] 500. thus most of the gains have come
[00:53] when readings are above 50 but it has
[00:56] also reduced drawdowns let's back test
[00:58] to see what happens if we hold for a
[01:00] longer time period the table below shows
[01:02] when we have readings above 50 and we
[01:04] hold S P 500 for n months see column 1.
[01:08] for example if we hold for 12 months the
[01:11] average gain per trade is 10.99 and we
[01:14] are invested 86 of the time see last
[01:17] column called exposure
[01:18] this is significantly better than any
[01:20] random 12-month period so what can we
[01:24] conclude from the back test
[01:25] the returns when ism is above 50 are
[01:28] significantly better than when it's
[01:29] below 50 and thus it pays off to be
[01:32] invested in stocks when the economy is
[01:34] expanding
