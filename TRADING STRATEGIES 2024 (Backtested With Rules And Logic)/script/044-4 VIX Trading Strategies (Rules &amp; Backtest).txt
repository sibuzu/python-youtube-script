[00:00] in this video we explain what the vix is
[00:02] how it works whether or not it can be
[00:05] useful for Traders and we end the
[00:07] article by back testing four specific
[00:09] vix trading strategies with complete
[00:11] trading rules and results
[00:13] each strategy is better than the
[00:15] previous so make sure you stick to the
[00:16] end
[00:18] the study of finances in practice a
[00:20] study of how people behave with money
[00:22] this means greed and fear some of the
[00:25] main determinants at least in the short
[00:26] run
[00:27] how do we measure greed and fear
[00:30] the vix indicator is an excellent tool
[00:32] for measuring greed and fear but what
[00:35] exactly is the VIX Index
[00:37] vix is called the fear index because it
[00:40] measures the implied volatility of the
[00:42] option premiums on the s p 500. the
[00:45] higher the option premium the more fear
[00:47] in the market when the uncertainty is
[00:49] high the higher the implied volatility
[00:52] and fixed values the VIX Index is listed
[00:55] with the ticker symbol vix and is
[00:57] calculated in real time
[00:59] let's show you a graphic daily display
[01:01] of the VIX Index
[01:03] as you can see vix goes from overbought
[01:05] to oversold conditions High readings
[01:08] which signals fear is often short-lived
[01:10] but vix tends to rise quickly but drops
[01:13] slowly
[01:15] what's a good reading of the VIX Index
[01:17] the vix and the stock market are
[01:20] inversely related when the vix Rises the
[01:23] stock market normally heads South a low
[01:25] reading means the market is complacent
[01:27] and could be a signal that the market
[01:29] participants are being too bullish and
[01:31] we're right for a negative surprise
[01:33] opposite a high reading might suggest
[01:36] that fear is too high and a rise in the
[01:38] stock market is imminent however there's
[01:41] no definite answer of what a good fix
[01:42] rating is because you need to do some
[01:44] Quantified tests to establish what has
[01:46] historically worked and not worked
[01:49] let's go on to back test the first
[01:51] strategy based on the vix indicator
[01:54] what is the daily Return of the S P 500
[01:56] when the vix is above and under its
[01:59] 20-day moving average
[02:00] when the vix is above its 20-day moving
[02:03] average the average daily return in the
[02:05] S P 500 from close until tomorrow's
[02:07] close is .05 percent
[02:10] the chart shows the equity curve of the
[02:12] strategy
[02:13] when the vix is under its 20-day moving
[02:16] average the daily return in the S P 500
[02:18] drops to .03 percent
[02:20] thus the return is significantly higher
[02:23] when the risk premium increases
[02:25] we discover the same pattern on weekly
[02:27] bars if the vix pattern is above its 10
[02:30] week average the weekly return in the S
[02:32] P 500 has been 0.25 percent
[02:35] if the vix has been under its 10-week
[02:37] average the weekly return in the S P 500
[02:40] drops 2.1 percent
[02:42] the conclusion is that we can expect
[02:44] higher future returns when vix is rising
[02:48] let's back test a strategy that's coming
[02:50] vix and Bollinger Bands to trade s p
[02:53] 500. we make the following trading rules
[02:55] let's buy the S P 500 if the vix breaks
[02:59] above its 10-day upper band two standard
[03:01] deviations away from the moving average
[03:03] exit when today's close is higher than
[03:06] yesterday's high
[03:08] the strategy makes .45 percent per trade
[03:10] which translates into 4.6 percent annual
[03:13] Returns the equity Rises steadily most
[03:16] of the time
[03:17] the return is below buy and holds 7.6
[03:20] annual returns but the strategies
[03:22] invested only 13 percent of the time
[03:25] Max drawdown for the strategy is only 22
[03:28] percent compared to 55 percent for s p
[03:31] 500.
[03:32] let's jump to our third Vic strategy
[03:35] which is a breakout strategy the trading
[03:37] rules read like this buy when Vic sets a
[03:40] new 20-day High and the five-day RSI
[03:43] must be over 65. exit when today's close
[03:47] is higher than yesterday's high
[03:49] we coded the strategy in Emma broker and
[03:52] got the following Equity curve the
[03:54] strategy is better than the last one and
[03:56] it makes point five five percent per
[03:58] trade which translates into 4.8 percent
[04:01] annual returns
[04:02] the return is below buy and holds 7.6
[04:05] annual returns but the strategies
[04:08] invested only 12 percent of the time
[04:10] Max drawdown for the strategy is only 22
[04:13] percent compared to 55 percent for s p
[04:16] 500.
[04:17] let's back test the fourth and last Vic
[04:20] strategy this strategy is the best to
[04:23] trade fix and it's what we like to call
[04:25] an overnight strategy because it holds
[04:27] the position only 24 hours
[04:29] we buy S P 500 at the close and we sell
[04:32] it to close the next trading day the
[04:35] equity curve looks like this
[04:37] since the year 2000 it's generated 577
[04:40] trades with an average of 0.28 percent
[04:43] we would argue this is pretty good for
[04:45] owning S P 500 for only 24 hours
[04:49] actually the strategy is beaten by and
[04:51] hold with a wide margin despite being
[04:53] invested less than 10 percent of the
[04:54] time
[04:56] how good the strategy is can be shown by
[04:58] 69 risk adjusted returns which we
[05:01] calculate by dividing the annual returns
[05:03] by the exposure or time spent in the
[05:05] market
[05:06] what is the trading rules of the
[05:08] strategy
[05:09] the trading strategy consists of three
[05:11] simple variables and we developed the
[05:13] strategy many years ago however because
[05:16] the strategy is so good we only reveal
[05:18] the trading rules for our Gold members
[05:21] in conclusion the vix indicator can be a
[05:23] powerful tool to help you identify
[05:25] potential trading entries in the stock
[05:26] market
[05:27] we've explained how you can use the vix
[05:29] indicator and in the long run it pays
[05:32] off to buy when there's fear in the
[05:33] market or as Nathan Rothschild once said
[05:36] the time to buy is when there's blood in
[05:38] the streets
