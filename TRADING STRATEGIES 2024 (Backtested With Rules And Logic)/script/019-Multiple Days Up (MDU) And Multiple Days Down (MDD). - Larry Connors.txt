[00:00] chapter six of Larry Connor's high
[00:02] probability trading contains a trading
[00:04] strategy called multiple days up and
[00:06] multiple days down if you stick to the
[00:08] end you'll find out how it is performed
[00:10] so let's get going in this strategy we
[00:12] look to buy when an ETF has dropped four
[00:14] out of the last five trading days the
[00:17] lower pane shows how the indicator works
[00:19] as expected it swings from low to high
[00:21] where a high number signals many down
[00:23] days and that's when we want to buy
[00:25] let's look at the trading rules the
[00:27] rules are like this one the closest
[00:29] above the 200-day moving average two the
[00:32] close must be below the five-day moving
[00:34] average three the ETF must have dropped
[00:37] at least four days out of the last five
[00:38] trading days four if one of three above
[00:41] is true then enter at the close five
[00:43] sell on the close when the ETF closes
[00:46] above its five-day moving average six no
[00:48] stop loss we downloaded quotes of 20
[00:51] different stock market ETFs and back
[00:53] tested the strategy from the year 2000
[00:55] until today on each of them the results
[00:57] vary a lot we made a second back test
[00:59] where we traded this strategy as a
[01:01] portfolio we allocated 20 percent for
[01:03] each signal and thus we hold Max 5 ETFs
[01:06] at a time the equity curve looks like
[01:08] this the annual return is low however
[01:10] the low returns can partially be
[01:11] explained by a very low amount of time
[01:13] spent in the market let's change the
[01:15] strategy to only trade spy and QQQ
[01:18] having 50 of the equity in each position
[01:21] we get this compounded Equity curve
[01:23] again the result is not impressive the
[01:25] equity curve is erratic and we would not
[01:27] trade this overall as you can see the
[01:30] results are not spectacular for this
[01:31] indicator but luckily for you we have
[01:34] hundreds of free strategies that are
