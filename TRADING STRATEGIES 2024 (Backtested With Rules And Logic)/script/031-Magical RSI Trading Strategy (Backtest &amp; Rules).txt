[00:00] today we look at the magical RSI
[00:03] strategy RSI is an abbreviation for
[00:07] relative strength index it's probably
[00:10] the most popular trading indicator but
[00:13] it also happens to be one of the most
[00:15] useful ones
[00:17] here we can see the equity curve and the
[00:21] strategy has a steady linear growth we
[00:23] started with 100
[00:25] 000 in 1993 and ended up with 1.4
[00:30] million today the chart is log scale
[00:33] meaning we look at relative changes
[00:37] the return is 56 per year if you use
[00:40] risk-adjusted returns the strategy is
[00:44] invested just a short period of time and
[00:47] we'll get back to risk adjusted returns
[00:49] later
[00:51] what's the strategy about
[00:54] the trading strategy is all about
[00:56] exploiting the mean reversion effect in
[00:59] the stock market
[01:00] mean reverse means that if an assets
[01:03] price debates significantly from its
[01:06] average it is likely to eventually move
[01:08] back towards that average
[01:11] this average in the stock market is the
[01:14] long-term uptrend because of inflation
[01:16] and productivity gains for example the
[01:20] U.S stock market has risen about 10
[01:23] percent annually over the last century
[01:26] however
[01:27] nothing is linear and panics do make
[01:30] prices occasionally go down sometimes
[01:33] the prices go down a lot like in 2022
[01:36] and 2008 for example
[01:40] and these are the situations we are
[01:42] looking to buy
[01:44] and we hope to exploit these short-term
[01:48] pullbacks by buying low and selling High
[01:50] by being invested just a few days per
[01:53] trade
[01:55] so in short we want to buy weakness and
[01:58] we want to sell strength
[02:01] why does the stock market revert to the
[02:03] mean
[02:04] well no one knows the exact reason but
[02:07] we assume that program trading is the
[02:09] major one Miner version didn't work
[02:11] until 1985 and it was about this time
[02:14] that program trading started to take
[02:17] effect
[02:18] all the reasons might be short covering
[02:20] Market beers Etc
[02:23] let's go to the trading rules which are
[02:26] really really simple so we're looking at
[02:29] the market which is S P 500 and we are
[02:33] back testing spider the ETF that tracks
[02:36] S P 500 but the strategy also works on
[02:40] other
[02:42] ETFs for example xlp which is consumer
[02:45] staple and XLV which I have which is
[02:47] Healthcare stocks and they assume it
[02:49] works on other as well
[02:52] so the entry is when the free day RSI is
[02:56] below 20. that's it it's just one simple
[03:00] criteria to enter
[03:03] and exit is when the free the RSI is
[03:06] above 60 or today's close is higher than
[03:11] yesterday's high
[03:13] and this is all so there are one rule to
[03:17] enter and there are two rules for the
[03:20] exit
[03:22] let's look at some trade examples when
[03:25] we run the back test in Amy broker we
[03:28] get the results like this for example
[03:30] the Green Arrow
[03:33] indicates a buy and the red arrow
[03:36] indicates the exit and here for example
[03:39] you can see here this is the relative
[03:42] strength index and here the the three
[03:45] the RSI is below 20 and you buy
[03:48] the RSI goes up because the price goes
[03:52] up and you sell
[03:54] and here you can see the second trade
[03:56] third trade and fourth trade all with a
[04:00] decent profits so the so during this
[04:03] period we had four trades in a row with
[04:06] a profit
[04:07] let's look at the back test results and
[04:10] statistics
[04:11] we had 351 trades since 1993 and the
[04:17] average gain per trade is 0.8 percent
[04:21] the annual return is 9.2 percent versus
[04:25] Buy and Hold which is 9.7
[04:28] and 78 percent of the trades are winners
[04:33] you are invested on average five days
[04:37] per trade that means you are invested 16
[04:40] of the time
[04:43] that means that risk adjusted return is
[04:46] 56 percent
[04:49] how to get to this number you simply
[04:52] take 9.2 percent which is the annual
[04:56] return of the strategy and you divide it
[04:58] by 0.16 which is the time spent in the
[05:02] market
[05:04] Max drawdown is 23 percent
[05:08] all in all we would say this is a pretty
[05:10] good result because you spend such such
[05:14] a small amount of time in the market and
[05:17] you still
[05:18] get the result which is more or less on
[05:20] par with Buy and Hold
