[00:04] Tuesday trading strategy a strategy we
[00:07] covered on our website as early as
[00:09] 2012 we'll show you how this simple
[00:11] strategy is beaten by and hold with
[00:13] significantly smaller draw downs and
[00:15] less time spent invested in the market
[00:18] will reveal its trading rules and
[00:20] settings so stay tuned Until the End by
[00:23] the way we're always working hard to
[00:25] create new and exciting content so your
[00:27] likes and subscriptions really help us
[00:28] out thanks
[00:31] but first what's the turnaround strategy
[00:33] all about it's a seasonal effect in the
[00:35] stock market that's been around for
[00:37] decades in short the logic behind the
[00:39] strategy is that the direction of a
[00:41] Monday is frequently reversed on a
[00:43] Tuesday as shown on the screen hence the
[00:46] name for example if Monday is a down day
[00:48] we can expect significantly higher
[00:50] Returns the next day than if it happened
[00:52] on any other day of the week as
[00:54] indicated on the screen the gains from
[00:56] Monday's close to Tuesday's close is 24%
[00:59] % if Monday's a down day and this is
[01:02] many times higher than the other days of
[01:04] the week opposite if Monday's an up day
[01:07] the return the next day is low let's
[01:10] back test a simple trading strategy that
[01:12] takes good use of the turnaround Tuesday
[01:15] effect we make the following very simple
[01:17] trading rules if today is Monday and the
[01:19] close is lower than Friday we buy at the
[01:22] close we use the Qs exit as sell signal
[01:26] which is when the close is higher than
[01:27] yesterday's high or after five trading
[01:29] days
[01:30] when we back test the strategy on spy
[01:33] the ETF that tracks S&P 500 we get a
[01:36] pretty impressive Equity curve just as
[01:39] impressive is the relatively small draw
[01:41] Downs of short duration the Max draw
[01:43] down is 24% but is shortlived apart from
[01:47] that draw Downs are in the single digits
[01:49] the turnaround Tuesday strategy is
[01:51] beaten Buy and Hold the strategy
[01:53] returned 10.6% annually compared to
[01:55] 99.8% if you bought spy in 1993 and held
[02:00] it until today you would also suffer a
[02:02] pretty devastating draw down of 55% if
[02:05] you bought and hold on to
[02:06] spy if we compare Buy and Hold to the
[02:09] turnaround Tuesday strategy we clearly
[02:11] see the almost spectacular performance
[02:14] of this simple strategy the ride is
[02:17] significantly more linear than Buy and
[02:19] Hold the strategy is even more
[02:21] impressive if we consider that you're
[02:23] only invested 24% of the time in other
[02:26] words you spend 76% of the time in cash
[02:30] this cash you can employ for other
[02:32] complimentary strategies in the meantime
[02:34] can the turnaround Tuesday strategy be
[02:36] improved it can for our paying
