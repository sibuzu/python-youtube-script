[00:00] value versus growth investing strategy
[00:03] hey everyone in today's video we're
[00:05] going to talk about value versus growth
[00:08] investing these are two of the most
[00:10] popular investment strategies and they
[00:12] have different approaches to picking
[00:14] stocks we'll present you with a specific
[00:17] trading strategy that rotates between
[00:19] these two asset classes and performs
[00:21] significantly better than Buy and Hold
[00:24] but first what exactly is value in
[00:26] growth
[00:27] stocks value investing is an invest
[00:30] strategy that involves buying
[00:31] undervalued stocks with strong
[00:33] fundamentals expecting the market to
[00:35] eventually recognize their value value
[00:38] investing aims to buy low and sell high
[00:41] and it's often associated with long-term
[00:43] Investments opposite growth stocks are
[00:45] stocks that are expected to grow at a
[00:47] faster rate than the overall market and
[00:49] more so than value stocks these stocks
[00:52] are often priced higher than value
[00:54] stocks because investors are willing to
[00:56] pay a premium for their growth
[00:58] potential over the long-term value
[01:00] stocks have outperformed growth stocks
[01:03] this is because value stocks tend to be
[01:05] more stable and less volatile than
[01:07] growth stocks but in the short term
[01:09] growth stocks can outperform value
[01:11] stocks this is because growth stocks are
[01:13] more sensitive to changes in economic
[01:15] growth and interest rates for example
[01:18] since the financial crisis in 2008
[01:21] growth stocks have outperformed value
[01:24] massively based on this let's make a
[01:26] rotation strategy that uses one simple
[01:28] trading rule to determine which asset
[01:30] class you should own how do we do it the
[01:34] value and growth rotation strategy
[01:36] involves shifting Investments between
[01:38] value and growth stocks based on their
[01:40] relative performance we base our
[01:42] strategy onto ETFs that track value
[01:45] stocks I USV and iusg respectively value
[01:49] and growth stocks we make a ratio
[01:51] between these two ETFs by dividing I USG
[01:54] by I
[01:55] USV then we calculate the ratios 10 and
[01:58] 40 we moving averages once we have that
[02:01] the strategy is pretty simple we trade
[02:04] the ETF that chose the strongest
[02:06] short-term momentum when value stocks
[02:08] are outperforming growth stocks we sell
[02:11] growth stocks and buy value stocks and
[02:13] vice versa as you can see our momentum
[02:16] rotation strategy is outperformed being
[02:18] long either ETF the outperformance is
[02:21] significant the annual return of the
[02:23] strategy is 9% while the best performing
[02:26] asset which was value only had 7.4%
[02:29] annual returns we even achieve the
[02:32] result by lowering the price variation
[02:34] normally referred to as risk there you
[02:36] have it but such a rotation strategy is
[02:39] not without its critics some investors
[02:42] argue that it's too difficult to time
[02:43] the market like we did and that it's
[02:45] better to Simply Buy and Hold a
[02:47] diversified portfolio of
[02:49] stocks if you like our video please like
