[00:00] today we show you three macd trading
[00:02] strategies complete with trading rules
[00:04] and back tests all backtests are based
[00:07] on S P 500 and the ETF with the ticker
[00:10] code s by and the best strategy comes
[00:13] last so make sure you stick around until
[00:15] the end by the way we appreciate your
[00:17] support if you want to help our channel
[00:19] to grow please give this video a like
[00:21] and consider subscribing to our Channel
[00:23] let's get straight to it and present the
[00:26] first strategy the first trading
[00:28] strategy is based on the macd histogram
[00:31] the macd histogram is the fast line
[00:34] subtracted from the slower signal Line
[00:36] This is a mean reversion strategy and
[00:38] the trading rules are on the screen we
[00:40] do this by buying when the macd
[00:42] histogram drops four days in a row from
[00:45] a level that was below zero four days
[00:47] ago the equity is growing nicely upward
[00:50] but the annual returns of 5 fail to beat
[00:53] the buy and hold of the S P 500 but that
[00:56] is explained by the load time spent in
[00:58] the market only five percent
[01:01] considering this we believe the strategy
[01:03] is decent because the low investment
[01:05] time frees up time to trade other
[01:07] complementary strategies the positive is
[01:10] that the strategy has a very high win
[01:12] rate of 89 and a low drawdown of 16
[01:16] let's go to the second back-tested macd
[01:19] strategy which uses a Bollinger band of
[01:22] the macd histogram we enter a long
[01:25] position when the histogram crosses
[01:27] below the lower Bollinger band and we
[01:29] sell when the histogram crosses above
[01:31] the upper band The 100 000 invested
[01:34] grows to 1.15 million today which equals
[01:38] an annual return of 8.4 percent the
[01:41] strategy's performance is mixed the
[01:43] positive takeaway is a solid win rate
[01:46] because we believe the win rate is
[01:48] crucial for most traders to stick to a
[01:50] strategy however the negative is the
[01:53] huge drawdown of 44 with such a drawdown
[01:56] We Believe most Traders would abandon
[01:58] the strategy even though the strategy
[02:01] forms almost as well as Buy and Hold
[02:03] despite being invested just 64 percent
[02:05] of the time now the third strategy is
[02:08] the best one unfortunately we only
[02:10] reveal its trading rules for our members
[02:12] but we can indicate that the RSI
[02:15] indicator is involved the strategy has
[02:17] only one trading rule to buy and one to
[02:20] sell the 100 000 invested compounds
[02:23] gradually without major hiccups along
[02:25] the way and we end up with 1.5 million
[02:28] today this strategy has three positives
[02:31] it spends only 21 invested has a max
[02:34] drawdown of only 15 percent and the
[02:36] annual return is almost as good as Buy
[02:38] and Hold It has many trades and the
[02:41] average is 0.56 per trade but it should
[02:44] be plenty of margin to pay for slippage
[02:46] and commissions the risk-adjusted return
[02:48] is 43 this number is the annual return
[02:52] divided by the time spent invested which
[02:55] is 0.21 we have now shown you three macd
[02:59] strategies let's discuss why why we use
[03:01] the trading rules and settings we did we
[03:04] have been trading full time for 20 years
[03:05] and we have learned a lot by using the
[03:07] macd indicator for some of our
[03:09] strategies first what is the best macd
[03:12] strategy for trading and is macd good
[03:15] for trading the macd indicator is not
[03:17] the best indicator for trading we
[03:19] believe that is the RSI indicator but
[03:21] the strategies in this video show that
[03:24] may CD can be very useful please also
[03:27] see the next video coming up about three
[03:29] RSI trading strategies the optimal
[03:32] approach to utilizing macd is by
[03:34] employing it as a mean reversion
[03:36] strategy similar to the three strategies
[03:38] outlined in this video The Objective is
[03:41] to purchase assets when the market is
[03:44] oversold and the price has fallen and to
[03:47] sell them when the macd readings are
[03:49] high this approach follows the
[03:51] conventional notion of identifying
[03:54] oversold and overbought conditions
[03:56] although the macd indicator cannot
[03:58] predict the future it provides a
[04:00] probability assessment historically the
[04:03] macd indicator has demonstrated
[04:05] Effectiveness in certain asset classes
[04:08] especially stocks making it suitable for
[04:11] short-term trading now let's address the
[04:13] question of which markets macd performs
[04:15] best in the answer is quite
[04:17] straightforward macd tends to work well
[04:19] in stocks particularly stock ETFs
[04:22] however its efficiency diminishes when
[04:25] applied to other types of assets the
[04:27] explanation is straightforward the stock
[04:29] market has a tendency to exhibit mean
[04:31] reversion this implies that oversold
[04:34] macd readings indicate the likelihood of
[04:37] better returns in the upcoming days
[04:38] whereas High readings suggest lower
[04:41] returns compared to the average
[04:43] during the past 35 years most Western
[04:46] Stock markets have exhibited
[04:48] characteristics of mean reversion
[04:49] nevertheless it is important to note
[04:52] that there is no guarantee that this
[04:54] pattern will persist in the future
[04:56] determining the most effective macd
[04:58] settings is relatively straightforward
[05:00] optimal results are achieved with a look
[05:03] back period of just a few days daily
[05:06] bars serve as the best time frame for
[05:08] analysis although weekly bars can also
[05:10] yield satisfactory outcomes when it
[05:13] comes to day trading macd is not
[05:16] particularly suitable it performs best
[05:18] in swing trading scenarios using daily
[05:20] or weekly bars as for the best
[05:22] combination with macd incorporating one
[05:25] additional variable might improve the
[05:27] results but please make sure you are not
[05:29] curve fitting your strategies on our
[05:32] website we provide a couple of
[05:33] strategies that incorporate another
[05:35] indicator resulting in improved
[05:37] performance that's all for today we hope
