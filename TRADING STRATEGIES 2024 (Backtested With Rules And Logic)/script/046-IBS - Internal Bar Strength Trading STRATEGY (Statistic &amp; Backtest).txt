[00:09] indicator or IBS for short and we're

[00:13] of the best tools you can use for your
[00:15] Stock Market trading in this video we're
[00:18] going to take you through not one not
[00:20] two but three different strategies that
[00:22] we've back tested and proved on a
[00:24] variety of ETFs all using the incredible
[00:27] IBS indicator and the best part you can
[00:30] easily start using these strategies
[00:31] yourself to turn a profit in the stock
[00:33] market so sit back relax and get ready
[00:36] to learn everything you need to know
[00:37] about the internal bar strength
[00:39] indicator and how it can improve your
[00:40] trading game this is one video you won't
[00:43] want to miss first let's start by
[00:45] explaining what the IBS indicator is
[00:47] about the formula reads like this
[00:49] today's close minus the low divided by
[00:52] today's high minus the low IBS is
[00:54] calculated daily and fluctuates from
[00:56] zero to one a low value means the market
[00:59] closed at the the bottom of its daily
[01:01] range while a high value indicates it
[01:03] closed strongly let's illustrate how to
[01:05] calculate IBS with an example the
[01:07] following Candlestick had a high of
[01:09] 74.66 a low of 7264 and closed at 72.75
[01:13] thus the IBS that day would be
[01:15] calculated like this 72 75 72 64 divided
[01:20] by 7466 7264 8 0.054 this was a very bad
[01:26] day for the stock where it opened down
[01:28] and continued falling throughout the day
[01:30] why does the IBS work the stock market
[01:32] has plenty of opportunities with
[01:34] long-term upward Trends driven by
[01:36] inflation and productivity gains and
[01:38] today we're going to show you how you
[01:40] can capitalize on those Trends using the
[01:42] IBS indicator the IBS is all about
[01:45] taking advantage of short-term market
[01:46] pullbacks and panics getting in and out
[01:49] of the market quickly to make big gains
[01:51] it's all about buying on weakness and
[01:53] selling on strength using the
[01:54] time-tested principle of mean reversion
[01:57] to your advantage when the internal bar
[01:59] strength value is low that's the signal
[02:01] that the market is bullish in the short
[02:03] term and when it's high that's a sign of
[02:05] bearishness by following these signals
[02:07] and making trades based on specific
[02:09] trading rules you can take advantage of
[02:11] the Market's natural mean reverting
[02:13] Tendencies and make profits so are you
[02:16] ready to see the IBS in action we're
[02:18] going to take you through a step-by-step
[02:20] strategy that will show you exactly how
[02:22] to use the indicator to make profitable
[02:24] trades get ready to take your stock
[02:26] market game to the next level let's make
[02:29] or first IBS strategy we buy the clothes
[02:31] when the IBS is below 0.1 and we sell
[02:34] when the IBS is above 0.9 we back test
[02:37] our simple trading rules on the ETF with
[02:40] the ticker code QQQ but before we go to
[02:42] the back test let's show a few trade
[02:44] examples the Green Arrow signal days
[02:46] when we buy and the red arrow signal
[02:48] days when we exit our position as you
[02:50] can see the strategy trades frequently
[02:52] let's return to our back test and find
[02:54] out how our trading rules performed on
[02:56] QQQ we back tested the strategy and Amy
[02:59] broker and our starting capital of 100
[03:01] 000 in year two thousand grows to almost
[03:03] 1.5 million in 2023. this is an annual
[03:07] return of over 12 percent significantly
[03:10] better than Buy and Hold despite being
[03:12] invested just 38 percent of the time the
[03:14] average gain per trade is 0.79 and we
[03:18] are invested on average seven trading
[03:20] days per trade Max drawdown is 21 and
[03:23] that is significantly better than buy
[03:25] and holds drawdown of over 70 percent
[03:27] let's make another strategy and show you
[03:29] a second variation of the IBS indicator
[03:31] we make a two-day average of the IBS
[03:33] indicator that means we add the values
[03:36] of the last two days and divide by two
[03:37] once again the trading rules are as
[03:39] simple as it gets we buy when the
[03:41] two-day average is below 0.25 and we
[03:44] sell when the two-day average ends above
[03:45] 075. we back test our favorite ETF xlp
[03:49] which tracks Consumer Staples like Pepsi
[03:52] Cola Costco and Walmart before we look
[03:54] at the performance of the two-day IBS
[03:56] average let's look at some trade
[03:57] examples the upper pane is xlp in the
[04:00] lower pane shows the two-day average of
[04:02] IBS the Green Arrow shows when we buy in
[04:04] the Red Arrows when we sell as you can
[04:06] see the average in the lower pane is low
[04:08] when we buy and high when we sell how
[04:10] did the strategy perform let's look at
[04:12] how a 100 000 investment would have
[04:14] compounded from 2000 until today the
[04:17] equity curve Rises steadily and the
[04:19] equity would have grown to 413 000 by
[04:22] today the 131 trades compounded at 6.3
[04:25] percent annually but you are invested
[04:27] just 33 percent of the time thus
[04:30] avoiding the worst drawdowns the two
[04:32] back tests shown so far in the video
[04:34] have proven how efficient the IBS
[04:36] indicator is however it's most useful as
[04:38] a complementary indicator let's show you
[04:40] how let's combine the three-day RSI with
[04:43] the IBS indicator this is our third back
[04:45] test of the day we make the following
[04:47] trading rules and back tested on s p
[04:49] 500. we buy when the three-day RSI is
[04:52] below 30 and the IBS is below 0.2 we
[04:55] sell when the close is higher than
[04:57] yesterday's high or the IBS is greater
[04:59] better than 0.9 let's show you some
[05:02] trade examples the green arrows shown in
[05:04] the chart is when the three-day RSI is
[05:06] below 30 and when the daily IBS is below
[05:09] 20. as usual the red arrows are when we
[05:11] exit the nine trades shown on the
[05:13] previous slide show seven profitable
[05:15] trades and two losing trades you can't
[05:17] make money on each trade but overall the
[05:19] strategy has a high positive expectancy
[05:21] let's show you how the strategy
[05:22] performed over the last 30 years on spy
[05:25] as you can see the equity curve has a
[05:27] steady upward slope with just minor
[05:29] drawdowns one hundred thousand invested
[05:31] in 1993 has grown to 1.5 million today
[05:34] that is 9.6 annually despite being
[05:38] invested just 18 percent of the time Max
[05:40] drawdown is only 23 percent compared to
[05:43] s p 500's 55 percent in 2008. as a
[05:46] matter of fact the strategy made a 47
[05:48] gain in 2008 since 1993 the strategy had
[05:52] only two losing years 2001 and 2018. for
[05:56] such simple trading rules the results
[05:58] are pretty spectacular that's all for
[05:59] today we hoped you like it and learned a
[06:02] lot and are feeling excited but before
[06:03] you go please remember to subscribe and
[06:06] like and good luck Trading
