[00:01] the famous investor Paul tutor Jones
[00:03] once said that the 200 day moving
[00:05] average is the first indicator he looks
[00:07] at why is that in this video we tell you
[00:11] why tutor Jones looks at the 200 day
[00:14] moving average and why it's a useful
[00:16] trading indicator we show you Trend
[00:18] following trading strategies as shown on
[00:20] the screen and how you can use the 200
[00:23] day moving average is a filter for
[00:25] short-term mean reversion strategies
[00:28] first let's show you how the average
[00:29] looks on on a chart the red line is the
[00:32] 200 day moving average and it moves up
[00:34] after the price has gone up thus it's a
[00:37] lagging indicator we also spot that
[00:39] there are many whipsaws when the price
[00:41] moves sideways which is a problem for
[00:43] all moving averages now let's look at
[00:46] why tutor Jones uses the 200 day moving
[00:48] average as a trend filter we're only
[00:51] invested when S&P 500 are over its 200
[00:54] day moving average and we sell when it
[00:56] ends below the average since 19 60 this
[01:00] simple strategy is performed well
[01:02] excluding dividends the return is
[01:05] 6.75% compared to buy and hold
[01:08] 7% what makes the strategy good is that
[01:10] you have smaller draw Downs compared to
[01:12] buy and hold Max draw down is only 28%
[01:16] compared to buy and holds
[01:18] 56% the reason for the reduced risk is
[01:21] that you avoid some of the worst bare
[01:23] markets for example the chart on the
[01:25] screen shows how you sold out in late
[01:27] 2007 and avoided the bare Market 2008
[01:30] until you re-entered in 2009 you avoided
[01:34] a 55% loss when the dust settles you
[01:37] start compounding from a higher level
[01:40] this is why Paul tutor Jones uses the
[01:42] 200 day moving average if the price is
[01:45] above it's a bull market and when the
[01:47] price is below it's a bare Market it's a
[01:50] simple concept but in trading and
[01:52] investing Simplicity helps you a long
[01:54] way let's look at how you can use the
[01:57] 200 day moving average to filter out
[01:59] when to take short short-term trades we
[02:01] use a standard mean reversion strategy
[02:04] to buy when the 5-day RSI is below 35
[02:07] and sell when it rises above 50 we back
[02:11] test the ETF the tracks S&P 500 spy
[02:14] since its Inception until today albeit a
[02:17] rising curve you would have experienced
[02:19] pretty tough setbacks the trading
[02:22] metrics are not bad but Max draw down is
[02:24] pretty high at
[02:26] 29% we suspect most Traders would have
[02:28] quit the strategy after such a loss what
[02:31] happens if we add a 200 day moving
[02:33] average filter the strategy is the same
[02:36] but the close needs to be above the 200
[02:38] day moving average to generate a signal
[02:41] adding the trend filter Smooths the
[02:43] returns the 200 day average filters out
[02:45] volatility and makes it easier to follow
[02:48] the
[02:48] strategy the number of Trades go down
[02:51] but the average gain per trade and win
[02:53] rate go up the win rate is an important
[02:56] metric because of the human bias to
[02:58] suffer more from A Loss than an equal
[03:00] win if we turn the trend filter upside
[03:03] down and only take trades that are below
[03:05] the 200 day moving average we clearly
[03:07] see that the performance is more erratic
[03:09] compared to when it's above that makes
[03:12] sense because history shows that
[03:14] volatility is twice as high under the
[03:16] 200 day moving average than when it's
[03:19] above can the 200 day moving average
[03:21] strategy be improved or made different
[03:24] please comment if you have
[03:26] suggestions good luck
[03:28] Trading
