[00:01] the financial Market Moves In Waves it
[00:04] rises and Falls which is why you hear
[00:05] slogans like buy the dip and sell the
[00:08] rip today we focus on the sell the rip
[00:12] trading strategy and show you how you
[00:13] can improve a trading strategy by using
[00:15] an improved sell the rip signal let's
[00:18] start by showing you a typical mean
[00:20] reversion trading strategy when the
[00:23] 3-day RSI drops below 30 we go long and
[00:27] we sell when it reaches 70 when we back
[00:30] test this strategy on S&P 500 we get the
[00:32] following Equity curve since 1993 until
[00:36] today the 391 trades return 61% per
[00:41] trade but the growth is pretty erratic
[00:43] with many huge draw Downs draw Downs
[00:46] reached 35% twice and most Traders would
[00:49] abandon the strategy by then thus it's
[00:51] not
[00:52] tradable we believe we can improve the
[00:54] strategy by implementing a sell signal
[00:57] that's slightly better at selling the
[00:59] rip this is a sell signal we've used
[01:01] ourselves for two decades and aims to
[01:04] sell a stock when its price has risen to
[01:06] a level considered
[01:07] overvalued we change the sell signal and
[01:10] sell when the close ends higher than
[01:12] yesterday's high the new sell the rip
[01:15] signal improves the strategy a lot as
[01:18] you can see both returns and draw Downs
[01:20] improve compared to the original trading
[01:22] strategy only twice are draw Downs more
[01:24] than 20% Which is a huge Improvement the
[01:28] annual return is almost as good as Buy
[01:30] and Hold but you're invested only 27% of
[01:33] the time based on this we argue this is
[01:35] a good trading strategy unfortunately
[01:38] the sell the rip trading strategy
[01:40] doesn't work for all markets for example
[01:43] for Commodities in Forex it's been
[01:45] inefficient those markets tend to Trend
[01:47] more than stocks and you'll often end up
[01:49] selling prematurely a back test normally
[01:52] solves the best approach for each market
[01:55] good luck
[01:57] Trading
