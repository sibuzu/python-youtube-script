[00:11] strategy with a back test a simple and
[00:14] effective way to trade the markets but
[00:16] before we dive into the details about
[00:18] mfi have you ever wondered how volume
[00:21] and price can influence the market and
[00:23] how you can use this information to your

[00:28] in the end of the video we'll go through
[00:30] the most common questions and some tips
[00:32] using the money flow index
[00:35] have you heard of the mfi
[00:37] the mfi which is an abbreviation for
[00:40] money flow index is a momentum indicator
[00:42] that measures the flow of money into and
[00:45] out of a security by combining price and
[00:48] volume data the mfi oscillates between 0
[00:51] and 100 and shows overbought and
[00:53] oversold conditions in the market
[00:56] the money flow index can be used for
[00:58] predicting potential price reversals in
[01:00] the market
[01:01] so how do we use the money flow index
[01:04] indicator to trade we have three simple
[01:06] rules when we backtest the spy and s p
[01:10] 500. if the two-day mfi is below 10 we
[01:14] buy at the close we sell at the close
[01:16] when the close ends higher than
[01:18] yesterday's high
[01:20] we have a time stop of 10 trading days
[01:22] that's it it can hardly get any simpler
[01:26] we tested different values for the best
[01:28] settings for the money flow index
[01:29] indicator and it seems like a short look
[01:32] back period is best
[01:34] but does this simple strategy actually
[01:36] work
[01:37] let's take a look at the performance of
[01:39] our trading capital
[01:41] we started with a hundred thousand
[01:43] dollars in 1993 and today we have over 2
[01:46] million that's a 20 bagger not too bad
[01:49] for such a simple trading strategy
[01:52] the annual return is 10.5 percent
[01:54] compared to buy and hold with an annual
[01:56] return of 9.7 percent however our
[01:59] strategy was only invested 35 percent of
[02:02] the time
[02:03] impressive right
[02:05] just look at the trading statistics
[02:07] yourself and the best part is that the
[02:09] money flow index trading strategy is
[02:11] easy to understand and execute even for
[02:14] novice Traders
[02:15] but don't just take our word for it head
[02:18] over to our website to check out the
[02:19] code for this strategy and hundreds of
[02:21] other free trading strategies
[02:24] now let's share with you some facts
[02:25] about the money flow index here are nine
[02:28] tips and common questions about the
[02:30] money flow indicator
[02:32] how do you calculate money flow index
[02:34] the calculation of the money flow index
[02:36] involves the use of price volume and a
[02:39] concept known as typical price
[02:41] these elements are used to gauge the
[02:43] buying and selling pressure in the
[02:45] market indicated as mfi readings which
[02:48] go from zero to a hundred
[02:50] the money flow index mfi and the
[02:53] relative strength index are SI are
[02:55] frequently mentioned as similar
[02:56] indicators in trading however they have
[02:59] some differences
[03:00] the mfi incorporates volume data while
[03:03] the RSI does not
[03:05] which one's better the RSI or the mfi to
[03:09] determine which one is better it's
[03:10] recommended to back test both indicators
[03:12] and evaluate their performance on these
[03:14] specific trading asset
[03:16] the mfi might work better on certain
[03:19] assets than RSI and vice versa
[03:22] when using the money flow index it's
[03:24] often beneficial to combine it with
[03:26] other indicators adding one additional
[03:28] indicator can enhance trading ideas and
[03:31] strategies
[03:32] so which indicator is best with money
[03:34] flow
[03:35] we recommend to back test different ones
[03:38] however it's important not to use too
[03:40] many indicators to risk curve fitting
[03:43] finding the right balance is crucial and
[03:45] it's recommended to conduct back testing
[03:47] to identify the most effective
[03:49] combination even though the money flow
[03:51] index can be used successfully as a
[03:54] standalone indicator
[03:55] is a higher mfi better a high money flow
[03:59] index suggests strong buying pressure
[04:01] however it's not always a reliable
[04:03] indicator for trading decisions
[04:05] what's the difference between high mfi
[04:07] and low mfi the significance of a high
[04:11] mfi reading depends on the specific
[04:13] asset being traded for instance in the
[04:15] case of stocks High readings often
[04:17] indicate an upcoming bearish reversal
[04:20] while low readings indicate stronger
[04:22] returns over the next days
[04:25] when you get to know the mfi indicator
[04:27] how do you trade the money flow index
[04:30] to identify overbought or oversold
[04:32] conditions using the money flow index
[04:34] certain thresholds are commonly used an
[04:37] mfi value above 80 is considered
[04:40] overbought indicating a potential
[04:42] reversal or downward pressure on the
[04:44] other hand an mfi value below 20
[04:46] suggests oversold conditions indicating
[04:50] a potential upward pressure or buying
[04:52] opportunity
[04:53] but again it depends on the time frame
[04:55] being used short look back periods have
[04:58] wild swings between oversold and
[05:00] overbought while longer look back
[05:02] periods tend to smooth out the swings
[05:04] when trading with the money flow index
[05:06] several factors can be considered not
[05:09] only overbought and oversold conditions
[05:11] these include identifying divergences
[05:13] and Trend reversals but both of them are
[05:16] trickier and offer less potential
[05:18] trading opportunities in our opinion
[05:20] we're at the end of the video but what
[05:23] are the limitations or drawbacks of
[05:24] using the money flow index mfi and
[05:27] Analysis
[05:28] false signals and sensitivity to
[05:30] volatile price movements are among these
[05:32] limitations but false signals are an
[05:34] inherent aspect of trading and you can't
[05:37] eliminate them
[05:38] trading's about odds and statistics and
[05:41] false signals are part of the game a
[05:43] good Trader knows that losses are part
[05:45] of doing business
