[00:00] all right today we practice the the
[00:03] marker indicator
[00:04] which indicates over bought and oversold
[00:07] levels as you can see here
[00:11] so we did an optimization of the
[00:13] indicator on spider
[00:15] and optimal look back period was five
[00:18] days and we used a buy threshold of five
[00:21] and we sold when the indicator hits a
[00:25] level of 80. and this is how the equity
[00:28] curve like
[00:30] not exactly perfect because of all this
[00:33] sharp and certain drawdowns so we made
[00:36] that a change to the to the cell room
[00:39] so instead of using the indicator we
[00:42] sell on strength and we sell when the
[00:45] close is higher than yesterday's high
[00:48] and
[00:49] and the equity curve is here and as you
[00:52] can see
[00:53] the strategy instantly improved
