[00:00] today we explain and show you seven
[00:02] algorithmic trading strategies and
[00:04] examples complete with trading rules and
[00:06] back tests you might wonder what
[00:08] algorithmic trading is it's the same as
[00:11] automated trading and uses a computer
[00:13] program that follows a strict set of
[00:15] trading rules to buy and sell without
[00:17] human intervention it's often referred
[00:19] to as algo
[00:21] trading however before we show you the
[00:23] results please be advised that nothing
[00:25] in this video is investment
[00:27] advice on the screen you see the Equity
[00:30] curves of all these seven algorithmic
[00:32] trading strategies we present in this
[00:34] video the best one is the last so make
[00:36] sure you stick to the end without
[00:39] further Ado we go straight at it and
[00:41] show you the first algorithmic trading
[00:43] strategy can a strategy be improved by
[00:46] averaging down or scaling in scaling in
[00:49] is when you divide your Capital into at
[00:50] least two parts and you buy it different
[00:52] predetermined intervals for example if a
[00:55] stock drops to 85 and you buy you might
[00:58] buy more if it drops to 80
[01:00] does this make sense let's show you a
[01:03] strategy example where we trade the ETF
[01:05] that tracks S&P 500 spy the original
[01:09] trading rules are simple we buy on
[01:11] weakness and sell on strength and we use
[01:13] the Qs exit the exit we invented and
[01:16] which is used all over the Internet we
[01:18] exit a position when the close is higher
[01:20] than yesterday's high the equity curve
[01:23] and performance is good and the average
[01:25] gain per trade is. 59% and the average
[01:28] return of 8.5 5% is just a tad lower
[01:31] than buy and holds
[01:33] 99.6% despite being invested just 22% of
[01:36] the time but let's change the entry
[01:39] rules instead of going all in we invest
[01:41] just 50% of our capital on the original
[01:44] buy Rule and we add the remaining 50%
[01:46] when the 5-day RSI value drops more than
[01:49] 5 percentage points compared to the day
[01:51] before for example from 33 to
[01:54] 26 the scalein rule improves the trading
[01:57] strategy a lot we get the same return
[01:59] turns but with a lot lower risk the
[02:02] scalein strategy is on the right the
[02:05] time spent in the market drops and as a
[02:07] result Max draw down is reduced from 23
[02:09] to 177% and lasts for a shorter time
[02:13] however such a scalein strategy only
[02:15] works in assets that tend to revert to
[02:17] the mean like stocks for
[02:20] example let's go to our second
[02:22] algorithmic trading strategy sell the
[02:24] rip
[02:25] strategy a lot of focus is spent on when
[02:28] to buy but just as important is when you
[02:30] sell to show you how let's make a sell
[02:33] the rip algorithmic trading strategy we
[02:36] start with the following trading rules
[02:38] we use a classical RSI strategy on the
[02:40] S&P 500 Index where we buy on weakness
[02:43] and sell on strength the strategy is
[02:46] profitable but not tradable in our
[02:48] opinion the strategy is not consistent
[02:51] and suffers from huge draw
[02:53] Downs let's change the cell rule instead
[02:57] of using a RSI cell rule we sell at the
[03:00] close when the close ends above
[03:01] yesterday's high the cell signal is what
[03:04] we call the Qs exit the strategy
[03:07] improves a lot compared to the original
[03:09] cell
[03:10] criteria the improved version is on the
[03:12] right and not only is the strategy much
[03:14] more stable but you also reduce draw
[03:16] downs and increase
[03:18] profits okay let's go to our third
[03:20] algorithmic trading strategy this one
[03:23] trades spy on the first trading day of a
[03:25] new month the first trading day is not
[03:28] necessarily the first calendar day so we
[03:30] emphasize that this is a trading day the
[03:34] trading rule is simple we go long at the
[03:36] close of the last trading day of the
[03:38] month and sell at the close of the first
[03:40] trading day the first trading day of the
[03:43] month performs much better than any
[03:44] random day the average gain is. 25% and
[03:48] offers a wide margin for commissions and
[03:50] slippage we've even improved the
[03:52] strategy for our paying members and you
[03:54] can see the equity curve on the screen
[03:57] and by the way a simple trading strategy
[03:59] is to own own stocks the last five
[04:01] trading days of the month and the first
[04:02] three trading days of the new month
[04:04] something we call the turn-of the Monon
[04:06] trading
[04:07] strategy the equity curve on the right
[04:09] is that particular strategy and on the
[04:11] left it shows the performance of being
[04:13] invested in S&P 500 at all other times
[04:16] basically all returns have come at the
[04:18] end and beginning of the new
[04:20] month let's look at our fourth
[04:22] algorithmic trading strategy this is a
[04:24] pullback trading strategy in trades S&P
[04:27] 500 the trading rules are simple
[04:30] the main idea is to have a trend filter
[04:32] which is the 200 day moving average to
[04:34] make sure we're in a long-term bullish
[04:36] trend for the short term we want to buy
[04:39] on weakness or a pullback our algo
[04:42] pullback trading system grows 100,000 to
[04:44] 1 million today which is a 10 bagger
[04:47] annual return is slightly below Buy and
[04:49] Hold but you're only invested less than
[04:51] 30% of the time the fifth systematic
[04:54] trading strategy is called Fabian timing
[04:57] model it was developed by Richard Fabian
[04:59] in the 1960s and is a quantitative
[05:02] long-term Trend following strategy for
[05:04] the stock market it's based on an
[05:06] intermarket signal between the S&P 500
[05:09] the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the
[05:11] utility sector the buy and sell rules
[05:14] for the Fabian timing model are simple
[05:16] and they're executed at the end of each
[05:18] week it's a very simple strategy if all
[05:21] three indices are above its 39 week
[05:23] moving average and belong S&P 500 sell
[05:27] when at least two indices are below the
[05:30] average we coded the strategy in Python
[05:32] and it's outperformed S&P 500 by a wide
[05:35] margin since the year 2000 despite being
[05:38] invested Circa half the time this is an
[05:41] easy strategy that you can run
[05:42] automatically at the end of each week
[05:45] let's go to our sixth algo trading
[05:47] strategy a momentum strategy developed
[05:49] by the famous money manager Meb Faber
[05:52] unlike the Fabian timing model this is
[05:54] not a market timing strategy but a
[05:56] momentum and Trend following strategy
[05:58] that trades stocks Bond bronze and gold
[06:00] we use the ETFs with the ticker code spy
[06:03] TLT and GLD to back test the strategy
[06:07] you invest in each asset where the
[06:09] 3month moving average is above the
[06:11] 10-month average if it's not you stay
[06:14] away it performed really well until 2015
[06:17] but has since then performed much worse
[06:20] the annual returns from 2005 until today
[06:23] is way below the historical average
[06:24] according to Meb Faber the long-term
[06:27] historical average is 13.1% and that's
[06:30] achieved with significantly lower Max
[06:32] draw Downs than owning
[06:33] stocks the seventh and last of today's
[06:36] algorithmic trading strategies is a
[06:38] strategy that's available for our paying
[06:40] subscribers it's a mean reversion
[06:42] strategy in trades S&P 500 it has just
[06:46] one variable to buy and one for when to
[06:48] sell and was published years
[06:50] ago 100,000 invested in 1993 and
[06:54] compounded until today has returned
[06:56] about 15% annually these strategy has
[06:59] managed solid returns despite being
[07:01] invested just 35% of the time and with
[07:04] significantly less draw Downs than Buy
[07:06] and
[07:07] Hold we've now given you seven
[07:10] algorithmic trading strategies and
[07:11] examples as you can see algo trading
[07:13] doesn't need to be complex the main
[07:16] advantage with algorithmic trading is
[07:18] that it gives you power because you can
[07:19] trade many automated trading systems
[07:21] from your computer at home this is how
[07:24] Jim Simons and The Medallion fund made
[07:26] 66% annually for 30 years such
[07:30] systematic trading as we've shown in
[07:31] this video can indeed be done on your
[07:33] own if you're willing to learn and spend
[07:35] some time on it more importantly you
[07:38] need to learn how to back test strategy
[07:40] something you learn by trial and error
[07:42] once you can back test automation just a
[07:44] minor step profitability has nothing to
[07:47] do with complexity quite the opposite
[07:50] the less complicated you do your Quant
[07:51] training the more profitable in the long
[07:53] run but you need a systematic mindset
[07:56] and believe in the law of large numbers
[07:58] for the odds to pan out
[08:00] let's summarize the video by briefly
[08:02] discussing the pros and cons of
[08:03] algorithmic trading
[08:05] strategies the pros and advantages are
[08:07] in our opinion obvious let's list them
[08:09] one by one one you make the strategies
[08:13] the computer does the heavy lifting once
[08:14] you have the strategies no need to stare
[08:16] at the screen all day two you can focus
[08:20] on developing strategies not doing the
[08:22] trading three automation lets you trade
[08:25] plenty of strategies the time spent
[08:27] trading is the same if you trade one or
[08:29] 50
[08:30] strategies four you're less likely to
[08:33] make behavioral mistakes because you
[08:34] keep a layer between you and the actual
[08:36] trading you're less likely to override
[08:39] trading
[08:40] signals unfortunately there are some
[08:42] cons and disadvantages one it requires
[08:45] some coding you need to invest some time
[08:47] in learning two experience via trial and
[08:50] error is important three you need to
[08:53] work for the strategies nothing is
[08:55] served to you on a silver
[08:57] plate okay that's all for today we hope
