[00:04] strategies complete with specific
[00:06] trading rules and settings so that we
[00:08] can back test them to find if they have
[00:10] worked in the past stick to the end and
[00:13] we'll also answer questions about the
[00:15] easiest indexes to trade and the best
[00:17] way to trade them by the way if you find

[00:33] content and videos thanks for supporting
[00:35] us now back to the three index trading
[00:38] strategies so what is index trading that
[00:41] is a financial index that tracks
[00:43] different asset prices for example a
[00:45] basket of stocks that said and without
[00:48] further Ado we jump straight to the
[00:50] first one of our three index trading
[00:51] strategies the strategy is called the
[00:54] Commodities to equity ratio trading
[00:56] strategy it might have a slightly
[00:58] difficult name but it has has performed
[01:00] well and we need to use two indexes to
[01:03] back test it the Commodities to equity
[01:05] ratio is simply a division between the S
[01:08] and P Goldman Sachs commodity index and
[01:11] S and P 500 of course you can also use
[01:14] another commodity index but Goldman
[01:16] Sachs is a widely used Benchmark the
[01:19] ratio indicates which index is
[01:21] outperforming or underperforming if the
[01:23] ratio is increasing it suggests that
[01:25] Commodities are performing better than
[01:27] stocks opposite a decreasing ratio
[01:30] implies that stocks are outperforming
[01:32] Commodities let's back test the strategy
[01:35] in Python and we use the following
[01:37] trading rules as shown on the screen the
[01:39] idea is to take advantage of the asset
[01:41] class performing better at any given
[01:44] time the equity curves show that the
[01:46] strategy beats buying and holding S P
[01:49] 500 although it's a bumpy ride it's a
[01:52] pretty volatile strategy but the results
[01:54] are inspiring the strategy returns
[01:57] almost nine percent annually which is
[01:59] more than 1 percentage Point better than
[02:01] S P 500 not including reinvested
[02:04] dividends you might wonder we why chose
[02:06] a moving average of 21 days is that an
[02:09] optimized setting no it's not the
[02:11] optimal setting the strategy works best
[02:14] with a short moving average and it gets
[02:16] less efficient the more days in the
[02:18] average let's go to the second of our
[02:20] three index trading strategies this one
[02:22] is also a rotation strategy where we are
[02:25] invested in a growth or value index ETF
[02:27] depending on the performance of each
[02:29] index why value and growth stocks are
[02:32] usually labeled growth or value and
[02:34] value has been one of the best
[02:36] performing factors of all time value has
[02:38] outperformed growth historically even
[02:40] though growth had a terrific last decade
[02:42] convi make a profitable index trading
[02:45] strategy that rotates between value and
[02:47] growth and is better than Buy and Hold
[02:49] let's look at two index ETFs that track
[02:52] value and growth iusv which tracks value
[02:55] stocks and iusg which tracks growth
[02:58] stocks we made a week strategy that has
[03:01] the rules shown on the screen it's a
[03:03] moving average crossover system and it
[03:05] has performed well since 2001. our
[03:08] rotation system has beaten both indexes
[03:10] nicely
[03:12] the annual return of almost nine percent
[03:15] is significantly better than both index
[03:18] ETFs and this is achieved with less
[03:20] volatility and risk this is exactly what
[03:23] we are looking for in an index trading
[03:25] strategy let's finish with our last
[03:28] strategy of the three index trading
[03:30] strategies this strategy is only for our
[03:33] paying subscribers and it's strategy
[03:35] number two on our landing page for
[03:38] member strategies the strategy was
[03:40] published in October 2021 and thus it
[03:43] has been live for almost two years in
[03:46] addition to the 12-month incubation we
[03:48] always use before we release or start
[03:50] trading anything it has one trading rule
[03:53] for when to buy and one for when to sell
[03:55] it can hardly get any simpler this means
[03:58] the reversion strategy has performed
[04:00] well on spy the ETF that tracks S P 500
[04:04] 100 000 invested in 1993 is worth almost
[04:08] 7 million today this equals an annual
[04:10] return of 15.5 percent with an average
[04:13] gain per trade of 0.8 percent which
[04:16] should provide a wide margin of security
[04:18] for slippage and commissions the returns
[04:21] are pretty good considering the strategy
[04:23] is invested only 35 of the time and has
[04:27] a modest Max drawdown of 22 percent and
[04:30] drawdowns don't last for a long time we
[04:32] have now presented you with three index
[04:34] trading strategies and we always
[04:36] recommend trading a diversified
[04:38] portfolio of trading strategies there is
[04:41] no sure thing in the financial markets
[04:43] and hence we recommend trading different
[04:46] markets time frames strategies and
[04:49] Market directions however we emphasize
[04:52] that the index trading strategies we
[04:54] used in this video are just examples and
[04:57] not investment advice always make sure
[04:59] you trade in a demo account before you
[05:01] trade live before we end the video we'd
[05:04] like to answer some typical frequently
[05:06] asked questions about index trading
[05:09] strategies which are the easiest indexes
[05:11] to trade first trading is not easy
[05:14] however we believe the stock market is
[05:17] the best to trade stock index trading
[05:19] strategies of which there are plenty can
[05:22] be found in multiple liquid ETFs that
[05:24] track an index the stock market is also
[05:27] very diverse our experience is that
[05:29] Commodities and Forex are the hardest to
[05:32] trade what is the best way to trade
[05:34] index trading strategies that depends on
[05:36] the market for stocks short-term mean
[05:39] reversion has worked well but also
[05:41] long-term trends because of the Tailwind
[05:44] from inflation and productivity gains
[05:46] that said you need to back test before
[05:49] you commit real money because there is
[05:51] no specific best way to trade an index
[05:54] what is the difference between trading
[05:56] stocks and index strategies the biggest
[05:59] difference is volatility because an
[06:01] index is the sum of the many it's
[06:03] normally less volatile than an
[06:05] individual stock you are more
[06:07] Diversified when trading an index
[06:09] compared to a single stock even if you
[06:11] are trading many stocks adverse
[06:13] movements from one stock can create
[06:15] havoc in your portfolio it's worth
[06:17] noting that trading stocks and index
[06:19] strategies are not mutually exclusive
[06:21] some investors employ a hybrid approach
[06:24] combining both trading individual stocks
[06:26] and using index strategies for broader
[06:28] Market exposure or hedging is index
[06:31] trading strategies better than Forex
[06:33] that one is easy to answer yes index
[06:36] trading strategies are better than Forex
[06:38] we regard Forex as the hardest Market to
[06:41] trade thank you so much for joining us
