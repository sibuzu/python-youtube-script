[00:01] sugar is one of the most important
[00:04] Commodities all of us eat it every day
[00:06] and the result is diabetes and it looks
[00:09] like too much sugar training can cause
[00:11] equal harm to your finances Commodities
[00:14] are hard to trade and our experience is
[00:16] that this applies to Sugar particularly
[00:18] and if something is hard to trade
[00:21] perhaps the best thing to do is to avoid
[00:22] it personally we are not trading any
[00:25] sugar strategy anyway here's the best
[00:28] sugar strategy we found after running
[00:30] hundreds of our trading rules
[00:33] buy when the price breaks above the
[00:35] 350-day moving average plus a seven day
[00:38] ATR sell when the price breaks below the
[00:42] 350-day moving average deducted a seven
[00:45] day ATR this strategy returns this
[00:48] Equity curve
[00:50] this is not what we would like to trade
[00:52] we recommend having a look at our
[00:54] website quantifiedstrategies.com
