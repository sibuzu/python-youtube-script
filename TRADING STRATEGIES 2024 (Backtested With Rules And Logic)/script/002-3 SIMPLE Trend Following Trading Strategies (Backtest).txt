[00:00] have you ever heard of trend following
[00:01] strategies in investing in this video
[00:04] we're going to dive deeper into what
[00:06] trend following is by proving three
[00:08] specific strategies and their historical
[00:11] performance
[00:12] finally in the end of the video we'll
[00:15] wrap things up by examining the pros and
[00:17] cons of trend following and whether it's
[00:19] a viable strategy for you to consider so
[00:22] sit back relax and get ready to learn
[00:24] how you can improve your trading game
[00:27] before we start we remind you that you
[00:29] find our best strategies on our web page
[00:31] we have hundreds of trading strategies
[00:33] proven with back tests and statistics at
[00:36] its core Trend following is all about
[00:38] capturing extended moves in the
[00:40] financial markets whether they're going
[00:42] up or down but here's the thing Trend
[00:45] followers aren't trying to predict the
[00:47] future they're not trying to predict
[00:49] tops and bottoms or anything else for
[00:51] that matter they're simply looking to
[00:53] take advantage of moves in different
[00:55] asset classes and capture as much of
[00:57] them as possible
[00:59] let's look at our Trend following
[01:01] strategies the first strategy uses
[01:03] monthly bars on S P 500 and the trading
[01:07] rules are simple
[01:08] when the close of the current month
[01:10] crosses above the 12-month simple moving
[01:12] average we go long
[01:14] when the close of the current month
[01:16] crosses below the 12-month simple moving
[01:18] average we sell and stay in cash until
[01:21] we get a Buy Signal
[01:23] we backtested the strategy on S P 500
[01:26] since 1960 and got the following Equity
[01:29] curve the annual return is 6.6 percent
[01:32] not including reinvested dividends and
[01:35] this is just a tad lower than buy and
[01:37] holds return of seven percent however
[01:40] the trend following strategy has
[01:42] significantly lower drawdowns at 26
[01:45] percent to see how good the strategy is
[01:47] we zoom in and look at the performance
[01:49] of spy the ETF that tracks S and P 500
[01:53] since its Inception in 1993. the red
[01:57] line is our Trend following strategy and
[01:59] you can clearly see you avoid much of
[02:01] the drawdowns if we factor in that the
[02:04] strategy was invested just 68 of the
[02:06] time we might argue the risk-adjusted
[02:08] return is significantly better at 9.6
[02:11] percent we find The risk-adjusted Return
[02:14] by dividing The Return by the time spent
[02:16] in the market let's go to our second
[02:18] strategy the golden cross the rules are
[02:22] simple when the 50-day moving average
[02:24] crosses above the 200-day moving average
[02:26] it signals a bullish breakout and you
[02:29] buy conversely when the 50-day moving
[02:32] average crosses below the 200-day moving
[02:35] average it signals a bearish breakout
[02:37] and you sell your position let's show
[02:40] you an example in this example the
[02:42] 50-day moving average broke above the
[02:45] 200-day moving average signaling a
[02:47] bullish breakout you could have bought
[02:49] the S P 500 in July 2020 at 2867 and
[02:54] ridden the trend until you sold in March
[02:56] 2022 at
[02:58] 4173 for a nice 32.4 percent gain of
[03:02] course not all trades turn out this well
[03:05] the Golden Cross strategy perform over
[03:07] the long term we back-tested the
[03:10] strategy on the S P 500 the 32 trades
[03:13] since 1960 returned this Equity curve
[03:16] the annual return was 6.6 percent and
[03:19] again this is slightly below buy and
[03:21] holds of seven percent but the return is
[03:23] managed with significantly less
[03:25] drawdowns because the strategy is
[03:27] invested just 69 of the time
[03:30] golden cross's results are impressive if
[03:33] we factor in the risk-adjusted return at
[03:35] 9.5 percent which we calculate by
[03:38] dividing the annual return of 6.6 by the
[03:41] time spent in the market 0.69
[03:45] today's last Trend following strategy is
[03:47] based on the super Trend indicator which
[03:50] is based on weekly bars the super Trend
[03:52] indicator calculates a median price of a
[03:54] candle and adds bans above and below the
[03:57] median price the bands use a 10-week
[04:00] look back period and three times the
[04:02] average true range the super Trend
[04:04] indicator takes on the values of both
[04:06] the lower and upper bands alternatively
[04:08] but with the condition that the lower
[04:10] band cannot decrease and the upper band
[04:13] cannot increase
[04:14] if this happens the super Trend
[04:16] indicator takes on the value of the
[04:18] relative band of the previous period
[04:20] when the closing price of a candle
[04:23] crosses the value of the super Trend
[04:24] indicator from the previous period the
[04:27] indicator begins to follow the opposite
[04:29] band leading to a reversal in trend
[04:32] let's backtest and we use the following
[04:34] trading rules for S and P 500 buy when
[04:37] the close of a bar crosses above the
[04:39] previous value of the super Trend
[04:41] indicator sell when the close of a bar
[04:43] crosses below the previous value of the
[04:46] super Trend indicator the example on the
[04:48] screen shows a trade example of 44 but
[04:51] of course not all trades turn out so
[04:53] well any Trend following strategy is
[04:56] dependent on a few big gains so it's
[04:58] Paramount you don't cut winners short
[05:00] when we back test on S P 500 we get the
[05:03] following Equity curve the 38 trades
[05:06] made annual gains of almost six percent
[05:08] which is one percentage Point lower than
[05:11] Buy and Hold but again the strategy is
[05:13] invested only 62 percent of the time and
[05:16] thus we can argue the risk-adjusted
[05:18] return is 9.5 percent
[05:21] you have now seen a few Trend following
[05:23] strategies and let's sum up the
[05:25] advantages of trend following the
[05:27] strategies we showed you today are all
[05:29] incredibly simple and they don't require
[05:31] much time to manage furthermore you are
[05:34] not timing the market and buy and sell
[05:36] signals are determined by the market
[05:38] however keep in mind that Trend
[05:41] followers have disadvantages because
[05:43] Trends are prone to sudden reversals you
[05:45] must expect to get whipsawed a lot the
[05:48] win rate is low and you must accept
[05:50] frequent losing trades most likely just
[05:53] a few trades make most of the gains and
[05:55] hence you need to fight the urge to cut
[05:57] winners short that's all for today if
[06:00] you are interested in code or to dig
[06:02] deeper into these Trend following
