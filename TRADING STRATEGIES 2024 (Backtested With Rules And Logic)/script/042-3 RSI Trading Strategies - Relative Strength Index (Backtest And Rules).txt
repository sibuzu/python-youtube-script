[00:00] today we show you three RSI trading
[00:03] strategies complete with trading rules
[00:05] and back tests let's get straight to it
[00:07] and present the first strategy the first
[00:09] trading strategy has the following
[00:11] trading rules we buy when the two-day
[00:14] RSI crosses below 10 and we sell when
[00:16] the two-day RSI crosses Above 80. This
[00:19] is called the two periods RSI strategy
[00:21] we backtested on S P 500 by using the
[00:25] ETF with the ticker code spy and we
[00:28] enter and exit at the close before we
[00:30] show you the equity curve please be
[00:32] advised that nothing in this video is
[00:34] investment advice okay let's return to
[00:37] the two-day RSI strategy which shows
[00:40] decent results our starting capital of
[00:42] 100 000 grows to 1.2 million after about
[00:46] 30 years which is 8.5 annually this is
[00:50] not too bad for being invested only 27
[00:52] of the time however we can make a second
[00:55] and improved strategy let's change the
[00:58] cell Criterion and sell when and the
[01:00] close is higher than the highest price
[01:02] from yesterday we buy when the two-day
[01:04] RSI crosses below 10 and we sell when
[01:07] the close is higher than yesterday's
[01:09] high if you are familiar with our
[01:11] website you'll know that this exit is
[01:13] what we call the Qs exit and is an exit
[01:16] we have employed for the stock market
[01:18] for over two decades the starting
[01:20] capital of a hundred thousand grows to
[01:22] nine hundred and fifty thousand a bit
[01:24] short compared to the first strategy but
[01:27] you experience a smoother ride with
[01:28] smaller losses we argue the second
[01:31] strategy is better why because the max
[01:34] loss from a peak in the equity comes in
[01:36] at 23 percent but is rarely worse than
[01:38] 12 percent you suffer less when using
[01:41] the second strategy the drawdowns in the
[01:44] first strategy are on the left side and
[01:46] the second strategy is on the right side
[01:49] on the right side the losses are both
[01:51] smaller and shorter resulting in a
[01:54] better recovery Factor exactly what you
[01:56] are looking for in a trading strategy
[01:58] the second strategy spends 10 percent
[02:01] less time in the market and hence gets a
[02:03] better risk-adjusted return the the
[02:06] performance metrics for the first
[02:07] strategy are on the left and the second
[02:10] is on the right we are Traders and we
[02:13] would prefer to trade the strategy with
[02:15] the best statistics and metrics and that
[02:17] strategy too on the right side let's
[02:20] show you our third and last strategy of
[02:22] the day an RSI trading strategy in
[02:24] Python called RSI momentum to make an
[02:27] RSI momentum strategy we first need to
[02:30] make two indicators as shown on the
[02:32] screen for this back test we are going
[02:34] to use the 100 days look back period and
[02:37] the 14-day RSI the trading rules are
[02:40] simple when we have established a bull
[02:43] regime we are long and we are out of the
[02:45] market when we are not in a bull regime
[02:48] when we employ the rules on spy we get
[02:51] the following Equity curve the strategy
[02:53] does not generate many trading signals
[02:55] there were 12 signals and only two lost
[02:58] money however it's a strategy that
[03:01] doesn't perform as well as the two
[03:02] previous mean reversion strategies we
[03:05] have now shown you three RSI strategies
[03:07] let's discuss why we use the rules and
[03:10] settings we did we have been trading
[03:12] full time for 20 years and we have
[03:14] learned a lot by using the RSI indicator
[03:16] for some of our strategies first what is
[03:19] the best RSI strategy for trading and is
[03:22] RSI good for trading the best way to use
[03:24] RSI is as a mean reversion strategy like
[03:27] the two first strategies in this video
[03:29] you'd like to buy when the market is
[03:31] oversold and the RSI readings are low
[03:34] and you want to sell when the readings
[03:36] are high it's a classical oversold and
[03:38] overbought indicator the RSI indicator
[03:41] can't predict the future but it
[03:43] indicates the odds historically the RSI
[03:46] indicator has worked well for certain
[03:48] asset classes and thus RSI is good for
[03:51] short-term trading second in which
[03:53] markets do RSI work best that one is
[03:56] easy to answer that is on stocks and
[03:58] especially stock ETFs it's much less
[04:01] efficient on other assets the reason is
[04:03] simple the stock market is prone to mean
[04:05] reversion meaning low RSI readings
[04:08] signal better returns in the coming days
[04:10] while high readings equal lower returns
[04:13] than average most Western Stock markets
[04:15] have been mean reverting over the last
[04:17] 35 years although there is no guarantee
[04:19] it continues being so third which RSI
[04:23] settings work best that one is also easy
[04:25] to answer the best setting is a look
[04:27] back period of just a few days the two
[04:30] and three day settings work best for
[04:31] stocks also the best time frame is daily
[04:34] bars even though weekly bars also work
[04:36] fourth is RSI good for day trading no it
[04:40] works best for swing trading using daily
[04:42] bars or candlesticks fifth what is the
[04:45] best combination with RSI RSI is more
[04:47] powerful by adding one variable on our
[04:50] website we have a couple of strategies
[04:51] that add another indicator which makes
[04:54] the strategy perform better that's all
[04:56] for today but please don't forget all
[04:58] next video about three mean reversion
[05:01] strategies and please like And subscribe
