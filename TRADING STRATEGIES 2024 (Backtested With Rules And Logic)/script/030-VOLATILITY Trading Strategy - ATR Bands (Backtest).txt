[00:00] today we'll discuss a strategy we made
[00:02] almost 10 years ago but is still firing
[00:04] on all cylinders it's a volatility
[00:05] strategy and works on a wide range of
[00:08] ETFs and Futures contracts in this video
[00:10] we'll show you how it performs and which
[00:12] indexes it works best on the strategy
[00:15] works well on most indexes for stocks
[00:17] but historically it has worked the best
[00:18] on NASDAQ 100 and hence let's start by
[00:20] looking at how the strategy has
[00:22] performed on NASDAQ 100.
[00:24] curve has a steady upward slope without
[00:26] any major drawbacks the drawdowns have
[00:29] been moderate
[00:30] and Max drawdown happened during the
[00:32] financial crisis in 2008 where it was
[00:34] down 18 at the most avoiding drawdowns
[00:37] is important to reduce the likelihood of
[00:39] selling into a panic the strategy
[00:41] doesn't trade much an average of eight
[00:43] trades per year but it has still managed
[00:45] to beat Buy and Hold handily with 13
[00:47] annual returns considering a trade lasts
[00:50] on average less than five days and it's
[00:52] invested only 11 percent of the time we
[00:54] might even argue the risk-adjusted
[00:56] return is significantly higher at almost
[00:58] 120 percent which is the annual return
[01:01] divided by the time spent in the market
[01:03] all years are positive except a small
[01:05] loss in 2005. a bear Market doesn't
[01:08] matter either as a matter of fact during
[01:10] bear markets the strategy performs just
[01:12] as well as in a bull market as proof
[01:14] look at the years 2000 2001 2002 2008
[01:18] and 2022. all years which were bear
[01:21] markets witnessed double-digit gains
[01:23] except 2022 does the strategy work on
[01:26] other indexes yes it does let's show you
[01:28] a few examples the first example is S P
[01:31] 500 the average gain is not as good as
[01:34] for Nasdaq 100 but it's still good with
[01:36] a one percent gain per trade let's go
[01:38] with our favorite trading instrument xlp
[01:40] the ETF that tracks Consumer Staples
[01:43] again the equity curve Rises linearly
[01:45] and has only small and short setbacks
[01:47] please keep in mind that slippage and
[01:49] commissions are not included in any of
[01:51] our back tests but they are minimal with
[01:53] so few trades in our videos we provide a
[01:56] lot of free strategies however today's
[01:58] strategy we only reveal for a moderate
[02:00] fee we trade the strategy ourselves and
[02:02] thus believe it's worth paying for
[02:04] however we can inform you that the
[02:05] strategy has three trading rules for
[02:07] when to buy one volatility rule One
[02:10] Price action Rule and one Trend filter
[02:12] rule we use one trading rule for when to
[02:14] sell but luckily for you we have
[02:16] hundreds of free strategies so please
