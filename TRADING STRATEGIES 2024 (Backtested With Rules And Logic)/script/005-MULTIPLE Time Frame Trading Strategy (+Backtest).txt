[00:00] multiple time frame trading strategy how
[00:02] do you make a multiple time frame
[00:04] trading strategy we'll show you how and
[00:06] provide an example with specific trading
[00:08] rules and back-tested results first
[00:11] let's define what a multiple time frame
[00:13] trading strategy is for example you can
[00:15] use a weekly time frame to determine the
[00:17] longer Trend daily bars to find the
[00:20] medium Trend and finally an intraday
[00:22] time frame to make the entry the main
[00:24] idea could be for example to trade with
[00:26] the long-term Trend but enter on
[00:28] short-term pullbacks we are sure you get
[00:30] the idea so let's make a strategy that
[00:31] tries to ride the long-term Trend but
[00:33] enter on pullbacks we make the following
[00:36] trading rules one we use a long-term
[00:38] Trend filter the close must be higher
[00:40] than the close 250 days ago two we use
[00:43] an intermediate Trend filter the close
[00:45] must be higher than the close 22 days
[00:47] ago three we use a short-term pullback
[00:49] the close today must be a three-day low
[00:51] of the close four if one three is true
[00:54] then go long at the close five we sell
[00:57] at the close when the close is higher
[00:59] than yesterday's close we get the
[01:01] following Equity curve on xlp the ETF
[01:03] that tracks Consumer Staples the trading
[01:05] statistics and performance metrics read
[01:07] like this number of Trades 316 average
[01:10] gain per trade 0.28 percent win rate 73
[01:14] percent max drawdown minus ten percent
[01:16] profit Factor two it works reasonably
[01:19] well albeit the average per trade as
[01:21] perhaps a tad too low as usual code and
