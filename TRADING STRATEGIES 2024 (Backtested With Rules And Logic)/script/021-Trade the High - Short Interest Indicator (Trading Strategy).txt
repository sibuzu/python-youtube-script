[00:00] is high short interest good or bad which
[00:03] stocks perform better stocks with high
[00:05] or low short interest stay tuned and
[00:08] you'll get the answer
[00:10] short interest in trading has been a Hot
[00:12] Topic since 2021 when Gamestop made
[00:15] short sellers Run for Cover at prices
[00:17] many times higher than their entry price
[00:19] but was the short squeeze in GameStop an
[00:22] outlier How likely are you to make money
[00:24] on stocks with a high short interest
[00:27] first let's define short interest the
[00:30] short interest is based on the number of
[00:32] outstanding shares that are shorted for
[00:34] example if a company has 1 billion
[00:36] shares outstanding and 50 million are
[00:39] sold short then the short interest is at
[00:41] five percent however the short interest
[00:44] ratio measures the average number of
[00:45] days it takes for short sellers to cover
[00:47] their short position for example if the
[00:50] short interest is 5 million shares and
[00:53] the daily turnover is 1 million shares
[00:55] then the short interest ratio is five
[00:57] the most shorted stocks have a short
[00:59] interest of about 20 percent while the
[01:02] lowest desiles have less than two
[01:03] percent but is high short interest good
[01:06] or bad in an article named the
[01:08] predictiveness of short interest the
[01:10] conclusion is that high short interest
[01:12] is followed by weak Returns the authors
[01:15] made the following chart one year
[01:17] returns what does the table and chart
[01:19] tell us on the left side we see that the
[01:22] deciles with the highest short interest
[01:24] have the weakest performance hence High
[01:28] short interest is bad for future returns
[01:30] and stocks like GameStop are outliers
[01:32] low short interest companies outperform
[01:35] the average company don't fool yourself
[01:37] by looking at anecdotal data and short
[01:39] squeezes a high short interest is likely
[01:42] not where you will find the next
