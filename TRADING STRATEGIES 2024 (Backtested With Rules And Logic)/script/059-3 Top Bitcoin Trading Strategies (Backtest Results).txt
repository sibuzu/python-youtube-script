[00:01] in this video we're going to reveal
[00:03] three profitable Bitcoin trading
[00:05] strategies you can see the results on
[00:08] the screen so make sure you stick Until
[00:09] the End we've published many Bitcoin
[00:12] trading strategies on our website
[00:14] Quantified strategies.com over the years
[00:17] and let's find out if they're still
[00:18] performing well let's go straight to the
[00:21] first of our Bitcoin trading strategies
[00:24] the first Bitcoin trading strategy is
[00:26] based off the macd
[00:28] indicator macd consists of three
[00:31] components the macd line the signal line
[00:34] and the
[00:35] histogram the macd line is the
[00:38] difference between the 26 and 12-day
[00:40] moving average while the signal line is
[00:43] the 9-day exponential moving average of
[00:45] the macd line but in this strategy we
[00:48] use the macd histogram in our trading
[00:51] rules which is the difference between
[00:52] the macd line and the signal line the
[00:56] trading rules for the strategy we're
[00:57] going to back test are very simple when
[01:00] the histogram turns positive we buy and
[01:03] sell when it turns negative we suspect
[01:06] the strategy might work because of
[01:08] bitcoin's momentum when it starts going
[01:11] we coded the strategy in Python and we
[01:13] got the equity curve shown on the screen
[01:16] if we followed the strategy we would
[01:17] have beaten Buy and Hold with a lot less
[01:19] temporary draw Downs the annual return
[01:22] was 77% versus only 61% if we bought
[01:26] Bitcoin in 2015 and held it until today
[01:30] even better you accomplished this with
[01:32] being invested only 54% of the time
[01:35] because of less time invested you
[01:37] suffered less
[01:38] losses let's look at the second Bitcoin
[01:41] trading strategy this one is also a
[01:43] momentum strategy that seeks to gain on
[01:45] the explosive moves in Bitcoin when it
[01:47] starts moving the trading rules are
[01:50] pretty simple if the price breaks higher
[01:53] than the close 25 days ago we buy and we
[01:56] sell when the price breaks below the
[01:58] close 25 days ago
[02:00] a very successful trade is shown on the
[02:02] screen signaled with the green buy arrow
[02:05] and the red sell Arrow Bitcoin gained
[02:08] 42% in 43 days of course not all trades
[02:12] are as good as that but if we look at
[02:14] all the trades since 2015 until today
[02:16] Bitcoin has had a pretty solid growth
[02:18] based on these trading rules the returns
[02:21] are significantly higher than HL even
[02:24] though the win rate is as low as 43% and
[02:26] you're invested only 56% of the time
[02:30] that means 57% of the trades produce a
[02:33] loss but still the strategy makes solid
[02:35] gains let's go to our third and last
[02:38] Bitcoin trading strategy this one's
[02:40] different it's a seasonal pattern that's
[02:42] worked well in the stock market and it
[02:44] turns out it's worked well for Bitcoin
[02:46] as well we buy Bitcoin on the fifth to
[02:49] last trading day of the month and we'll
[02:51] sell on the third trading day of the new
[02:53] month most of the trades end up
[02:55] profitable like the one on the screen
[02:57] which had a 6.6% gain
[03:00] if we look at all trades we see that the
[03:02] strategy has performed really well but
[03:05] it's flattened lately the average gain
[03:07] per trade is 3.2% and you make almost
[03:10] 41% annually while being invested only
[03:13] 23% of the time we've shown you three
[03:16] Bitcoin trading strategies but we remind
[03:18] you that we have many more Bitcoin
[03:20] strategies on our website Quantified
