[00:00] welcome to Quantified strategies today
[00:03] we show you three ETF trading strategies
[00:06] complete with specific trading rules and
[00:08] settings so that we can find out how
[00:10] they've
[00:11] performed let's jump straight to our
[00:13] first strategy of this video the
[00:15] turnaround Tuesday
[00:17] strategy this strategy has worked in the
[00:20] stock market for many decades and has
[00:22] been lwh hanging fruit for many years we
[00:24] wrote about this strategy on our website
[00:26] as long back as
[00:27] 2012 by the way we're always working
[00:30] hard to create new and exciting content
[00:32] so your likes and subscriptions really
[00:34] help us out
[00:35] thanks so what's this ETF strategy all
[00:38] about we buy S&P 500 at the close on a
[00:42] Monday if the close is lower than on
[00:44] Friday or the last trading day if Friday
[00:46] was a non-trading day that's it it can
[00:49] hardly get any simpler than that we sell
[00:52] on a day when the close ends higher than
[00:54] yesterday's high or after five trading
[00:56] days a trade example is shown on the
[00:58] screen the the Green Arrow shows a
[01:01] Monday where spy the ETF the tracks S&P
[01:04] 500 opens up but Falls throughout the
[01:06] day and ends lower than Friday we buy
[01:09] and sell 2 days later when spy rallies
[01:12] and closes above the yesterday's high
[01:15] the equity curve shows that 100,000
[01:17] invested in spy in 1993 is worth almost
[01:21] 2.2 million today if we only trade this
[01:24] ETF
[01:25] strategy not too bad for being such a
[01:28] simple strategy and being invested only
[01:30] 24% of the time the strategy is beaten
[01:33] bu and hold with significantly lower
[01:36] draw Downs of only
[01:37] 23% even better the strategy can be
[01:40] improved to increase the average gain
[01:42] per trade something we did on our
[01:44] website and for our paying
[01:47] subscribers let's go to the second ETF
[01:49] trading strategy this one's also one of
[01:52] the hundreds of ETF trading strategies
[01:54] we've published on our website since we
[01:56] started writing in
[01:57] 2012 the strategy is called lower lows
[02:01] and lower highs and was published years
[02:03] ago it's a mean reversion strategy and
[02:06] works for many stock
[02:07] ETFs the trading rules and settings are
[02:10] pretty straightforward and we buy when
[02:12] both the low and high of the day is
[02:14] lower for the third day in a row we buy
[02:17] on weakness and sell on strength a trade
[02:20] example in QQQ is shown on the screen
[02:23] where we buy on the third day of
[02:24] weakness and we sell 2 days later on an
[02:27] up day when the close is higher than
[02:29] yesterday's high
[02:30] the equity curve is not as good as the
[02:32] turnaround Tuesday strategy but still
[02:35] the 100,000 compounds at almost 8%
[02:38] annually and ends up above
[02:40] 600,000 the average gain per trade is
[02:43] almost 1% but the strategy suffers a
[02:45] draw down of 31% during the bare Market
[02:48] of 2000 to 2003 but since then it's
[02:51] performed really
[02:53] well this ETF trading strategy Works
[02:56] nicely on other stock ETFs as well even
[02:58] bonds let's go to the third of our ETF
[03:01] trading strategies this one's slightly
[03:04] more complicated and involves three
[03:06] ETFs the strategy was developed by the
[03:09] famous podcaster and money manager Meb
[03:11] Faber and published around
[03:13] 2015 it's a momentum rotation strategy
[03:16] for stocks bonds and gold that uses
[03:18] monthly bars we use the following ETFs
[03:22] spy for s&p500 GLD for gold and TLT for
[03:27] bonds at the end of the month we invest
[03:30] or stay long when the 3-month simple
[03:32] moving average is above the 10-month
[03:34] moving average we allocate onethird of
[03:36] our Capital to each ETF for example if
[03:39] we get a signal in two ETFs we invest
[03:42] 66% of our equity and stay 33% in
[03:47] cash let's back test the
[03:49] strategy the strategy worked really well
[03:52] until 2015 when the strategy was
[03:54] published but since then it's not
[03:56] performed so well the annual return is
[03:59] is almost 8% and Max draw down is modest
[04:02] at only
[04:04] 18% is the poor performance after 2015
[04:07] just a temporary setback that's hard to
[04:10] tell but periods of weak performance is
[04:12] to be expected the back test that Meb
[04:15] Faber did goes back to 1971 and it's
[04:18] likely that any period of less than 10
[04:20] years will be erratic this is a
[04:22] long-term momentum and Trend following
[04:24] strategy and patience is
[04:26] required we've now shown you three ETF
[04:29] trading strategies but please be advised
[04:32] that nothing in this video is investment
[04:34] advice always do your own research and
[04:36] make sure you put your strategies in a
[04:38] demo account for 12 months before you
[04:39] commit real money we've been running our
[04:42] website since 2012 and we received many
[04:45] questions from readers below we've
[04:47] compiled some of the most typical and
[04:48] frequently asked questions about ETF
[04:51] trading what is the best ETF strategy
[04:54] are there best ETF trading
[04:57] strategies there is no best ETF F
[04:59] trading strategy instead you want to
[05:02] have many trading strategies that trade
[05:04] different ETFs different time frames and
[05:06] different Market directions both long
[05:08] and short the power is in
[05:10] diversification and strategies that
[05:12] complement each
[05:14] other can you swing trade ETFs of course
[05:17] you can the strategies in this video
[05:20] show examples of how it can be
[05:22] done what are the advantages of ETF
[05:25] trading strategies the main advantage is
[05:27] that you invest in a basket of stocks
[05:29] and thus you reduce the chances of
[05:31] gut-wrenching adverse movements a single
[05:34] stock can fall 100% And rise unlimited
[05:37] forcing you to go belly up if you're
[05:39] short moreover ETFs can also be a great
[05:42] substitute if you're trading single
[05:43] stocks ETFs can be used for hedging or
[05:46] diversification for
[05:48] example what are the disadvantages of
[05:51] ETF trading
[05:52] strategies the disadvantage is that
[05:54] you're unlikely to have huge winners a
[05:57] stock can rise 500% but this is unlikely
[06:00] for an ETF unless you own it for decades
[06:03] however for most retail Traders the
[06:05] wisest thing to do is to buy different
[06:07] asset classes and let time do the
[06:10] compounding are ETF trading strategies
[06:12] good for beginners we believe so however
[06:16] you should always start trading in a
[06:18] demo account and wait at least 12 months
[06:20] before you go live with a back tested
[06:22] ETF strategy we believe it's better to
[06:24] trade ETFs before you start trading
[06:27] individual stocks our ETF trading
[06:30] strategies best for long or short-term
[06:32] trading we think you should trade both
[06:35] long and shortterm the next video coming
[06:38] up called three profitable trading
[06:39] strategies show you how you can combine
[06:42] long and short-term ETF trading and
[06:44] investing you want to diversify into
[06:46] several strategies that complement each
[06:49] other what are the best ETF trading
[06:52] strategies there are no single best ETF
[06:55] trading strategies you want a
[06:57] portfolio can you day trade ETF trading
[07:00] strategies sure but day trading is
[07:03] harder than swing trading day trading is
[07:05] noisy meaning it's hard to find
[07:07] tradeable patterns that last for a long
[07:09] time we believe the best opportunities
[07:11] for retail Traders are in using longer
[07:13] time frames for example daily weekly or
[07:16] monthly
[07:17] bars we appreciate you taking the time
