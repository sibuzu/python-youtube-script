[00:00] welcome to Quantified strategies in this
[00:03] video about three profitable trading
[00:05] strategies complete with trading rules
[00:07] and back tests based on S P 500 and
[00:10] NASDAQ 100.
[00:12] we show you one mean reversion trading
[00:14] strategy one Trend following strategy
[00:16] and one strategy that combines both
[00:19] strategies into one profitable trading
[00:21] strategy
[00:22] let's get straight to it and present the
[00:24] first profitable trading strategy the
[00:27] rubber band strategy
[00:29] it was presented on our website as long
[00:31] back as 2013 and thus we have plenty of
[00:34] data to find out how it's performed
[00:35] after it was released
[00:37] the trading rules on the screen indicate
[00:39] that this is a mean reversion strategy
[00:42] we buy on weakness and sell on strength
[00:44] mean reversion has worked very well for
[00:47] stock since about 1985 although there's
[00:49] no way of knowing how long it'll last
[00:52] the strategy is performed well as
[00:54] indicated by the equity curve but best
[00:56] before 2015.
[00:58] the one hundred thousand invested in
[01:01] 1993 is grown to 870 000 which is an
[01:04] annual return of 7.4 percent dividends
[01:07] included
[01:08] it's not managed to be Buy and Hold but
[01:11] that's not to be expected because the
[01:12] strategy is invested only fourteen
[01:14] percent of the time
[01:15] if we adjust for the time spent in the
[01:18] market we might argue the risk-adjusted
[01:20] return is 51 percent
[01:22] by the way we appreciate your support if
[01:24] you want to help our channel to grow
[01:26] please give this video a like and
[01:27] consider subscribing to our Channel
[01:30] let's switch to the second profitable
[01:32] trading strategy this one can be labeled
[01:35] Trend following in trades infrequently
[01:37] the strategy is called the Golden Cross
[01:39] trading strategy and is based on two
[01:42] moving averages the shorter 50-day
[01:44] moving average and the longer 200-day
[01:46] moving average we use a simple moving
[01:49] average but it's performed better with
[01:51] an exponential average
[01:52] the trading rules which is a crossover
[01:55] system can hardly get any simpler the
[01:57] main idea is to avoid long and severe
[01:59] drawdowns
[02:01] the capital compounds at 6.6 percent
[02:03] just a tad lower than Buy and Hold 6.9
[02:06] percent not including dividends
[02:08] there are only 33 trades since 1960 but
[02:11] Max drawdown is reduced dramatically
[02:13] because you avoid severe drawdowns Max
[02:16] drawdown is 33 percent compared to buy
[02:18] and holds 56 percent
[02:21] we've marked in yellow the most recent
[02:23] bear markets and you would have avoided
[02:25] almost all of it any drawdowns more than
[02:27] 20 percent only last a very short time
[02:29] and the ride is a much smoother one than
[02:32] Buy and Hold
[02:33] the chart shows the bear markets of 1973
[02:36] to 1974 2000 to 2003 2008 to 2009 and
[02:42] 2022 were mostly avoided completely
[02:45] however in a Raging Bull Market this
[02:47] profitable trading strategy is likely to
[02:49] underperform
[02:51] let's show our third and last profitable
[02:53] trading strategy of the day we combine
[02:55] the two strategies into one portfolio of
[02:58] two trading strategies
[03:00] why do we do that because both trading
[03:03] strategies are not invested all the time
[03:05] and profitable short-term mean reversion
[03:07] strategies have worked well in a bear
[03:09] Market when S P 500 is trading under its
[03:12] 200-day moving average
[03:14] thus we believe the two trading
[03:16] strategies complement each other
[03:18] let's make a combined trading strategy
[03:20] where we trade the rubber band strategy
[03:22] only when the long 200-day moving
[03:24] average is above the short 50-day moving
[03:26] average let's make the following trading
[03:29] rules
[03:30] the rules as shown on the screen are
[03:32] slightly more complex but still
[03:34] relatively easy to code the main idea is
[03:36] to trade short-term mean reversion when
[03:38] we're in a bear market and stay long
[03:40] when the trend is bullish
[03:42] let's back test the combined profitable
[03:44] trading strategy on spy the ETF that
[03:48] tracks the S P 500 and include
[03:50] reinvested dividends
[03:52] the 100 000 grows to over 2.5 million
[03:55] which equals annual returns of 11.2
[03:58] percent and Max drawdown is 33
[04:01] significantly lower than buy and holds
[04:04] the strategy is highly profitable and is
[04:07] outperformed by and hold significantly
[04:10] the number of Trades is 103 and the
[04:12] average gain is almost 4 percent per
[04:14] trade but the high average is of course
[04:16] due to many large Trend following
[04:18] winners let's backtest the exact same
[04:20] trading rules on QQQ the ETF that tracks
[04:23] NASDAQ 100 the equity compounds nicely
[04:26] at 13.6 percent per year compared to
[04:29] only 9.1 percent for Buy and Hold
[04:32] the profitable trading strategy is
[04:34] invested only 71 percent of the time yet
[04:37] it's managed solid and consistent
[04:39] returns with modest and short-lived
[04:41] drawdowns
[04:42] the combined trading strategy is not
[04:44] curve fitted in any way and you can get
[04:46] better returns by adjusting the settings
[04:48] this trading strategy indicates that you
[04:51] can successfully employ two types of
[04:53] trading strategies with different time
[04:54] Horizons both long and short term that
[04:57] complement each other you increase
[04:59] returns without having larger drawdowns
[05:01] We Believe diversification is the only
[05:04] Holy Grail in trading to make profitable
[05:06] trading strategies many Traders waste
[05:09] their time trying to make a good
[05:10] strategy and do a perfect one only to
[05:12] realize that trading results don't match
[05:14] the curve fitted back tests making the
[05:16] trading strategy useless in predicting
[05:18] the future
[05:20] but many sub-optimal trading strategies
[05:22] can potentially be used to make a
[05:24] portfolio of strategies as strategy 3
[05:27] indicates the most profitable trading
[05:29] strategy only exists in theory we
[05:32] believe it's smart to trade many markets
[05:34] or asset classes trade different types
[05:36] of strategies trade both long and short
[05:38] and finally trade different time
[05:40] Horizons
[05:42] there's no sure thing in the financial
[05:43] markets but it's always wise to trade
[05:45] Diversified strategies
[05:47] the trading strategies we used in this
[05:49] video are just examples and not
[05:51] investment advice but we hope you get
[05:53] the idea how to make profitable trading
[05:55] strategies let's end the article with
[05:57] some FAQ about how to make a profitable
[06:00] trading strategy
[06:01] first what's the best approach to making
[06:03] a profitable trading strategy
[06:06] our approach in general is all about
[06:08] back testing you need to get an idea
[06:10] make specific trading rules and back
[06:12] test it to find out if it's performed
[06:14] well in the past
[06:15] if it's performed well you put the
[06:17] strategy in incubation or demo account
[06:19] for at least 12 months to see if the
[06:21] strategy is able to make good
[06:23] predictions
[06:24] second what's the most profitable
[06:26] trading strategy
[06:27] as we indicated earlier in the video
[06:29] there's no optimal or perfect strategy
[06:31] we believe the optimal strategic trading
[06:34] tactic is to trade many strategies that
[06:36] complement each other the best trading
[06:39] strategies trade different markets time
[06:41] frames and Market directions
[06:43] third how long can you expect a
[06:45] profitable trading strategy to last
[06:48] unfortunately a trading strategy in most
[06:50] cases has a finite life this is one of
[06:53] the reasons why you want to have many
[06:55] strategies that trade different markets
[06:57] time frames and Market directions
[07:00] you don't want to be dependent on one
[07:01] single strategy
[07:03] we also believe that the most profitable
[07:05] trading strategies are found in stocks
[07:07] and bonds these two markets have a
[07:09] long-term tailwind and most strategies
[07:11] are likely to last longer than in Forex
[07:14] and commodities for example that was all
[07:16] for today and we hope you like it and
[07:18] stay tuned for the next video coming up
[07:19] showing three different RSI trading
[07:22] strategies also please check out our
[07:24] list of trading strategies on our
[07:26] website we have hundreds of back tested
[07:28] trading strategies
[07:31] thank you
