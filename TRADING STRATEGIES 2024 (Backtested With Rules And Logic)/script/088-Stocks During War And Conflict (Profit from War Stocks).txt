[00:00] how does War affect the stock market
[00:02] historically should you buy or sell when
[00:05] you hear the sound of cannons let's look
[00:07] at how stocks have performed during
[00:09] conflicts and Wars on the screen you'll
[00:12] see how the S&P 500 is performed after
[00:14] major conflicts perhaps surprisingly the
[00:17] max loss after such events is not large
[00:20] only 20% Which happened after Pearl
[00:22] Harbor in fact some studies show that
[00:25] stock markets tend to have less
[00:26] volatility and better returns during
[00:28] Wars and conflicts than during peaceful
[00:30] times how's that possible one
[00:34] explanation might be that Wars stimulate
[00:36] government spending and economic
[00:38] activity however we suspect the main
[00:40] reason is that Wars are often
[00:42] anticipated and priced in by the markets
[00:44] before they start so the actual outbreak
[00:46] doesn't cause much surprise or Panic for
[00:49] example on the screen you see that US
[00:51] Stocks already had fallen prior to the
[00:53] attack on Pearl Harbor and just a few
[00:55] weeks later the stock market rallied and
[00:57] it didn't look bad Dow Jones Rose over
[01:00] 60% in real returns before the Germans
[01:02] and the Japanese
[01:04] surrendered another interesting fact is
[01:06] that volatility drops during conflicts
[01:08] which is very
[01:10] counterintuitive on the screen you'll
[01:12] see defense expenditures and stock
[01:14] market volatility it shows an inverse
[01:16] relationship where higher defense
[01:18] expenditures are associated with lower
[01:21] volatility of course not all wars are
[01:23] good for stocks Wars that are fought on
[01:25] home soil can have devastating effects
[01:27] on the real economy and the stock market
[01:30] the US has been spared for conflicts at
[01:32] home since the Civil War Germany lay in
[01:35] Ruins after World War II and the stock
[01:37] market was closed for several years when
[01:39] it opened in 1945 it opened 90% lower
[01:44] the same goes for Russia where all was
[01:45] lost in 1917 until it restarted in
[01:49] 1991 moreover Wars can affect other
[01:52] asset classes differently such as gold
[01:54] oil or bonds for example gold has
[01:58] several times spiked on news of War for
[02:00] later to pull back as it can be seen on
[02:02] the chart on the
[02:03] screen so in conclusion how should
[02:06] investors react to news of war the
[02:09] answer is not simple but as a general
[02:11] rule if your local market is not part of
[02:13] the conflict it might be wise to follow
[02:16] the famous advice of Nathan Rothschild
[02:18] buy to the sound of cannons sell to the
[02:21] sound of
[02:22] trumpets that was all for today but
