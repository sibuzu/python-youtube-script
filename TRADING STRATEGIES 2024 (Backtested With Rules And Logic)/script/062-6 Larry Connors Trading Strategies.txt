[00:00] today we explain and show you six
[00:02] trading strategies developed by Larry
[00:05] Connors and his team they are all taken
[00:07] from his books called high probability
[00:10] ETF trading and short-term trading
[00:12] strategies that work but we have
[00:14] slightly changed the trading rules and
[00:16] improved the strategies just like we did
[00:18] in our articles on the website years ago
[00:21] all strategies were developed before
[00:23] 2010 and thus we can find out if they
[00:26] have stood the test of time
[00:28] all strategies come with complete
[00:30] trading rules and back tests and all
[00:32] back tests are for S P 500 and its ETF
[00:35] with the ticker code spy by the way we
[00:39] appreciate your support if you want to
[00:41] help our channel to grow please give
[00:43] this video a like and consider
[00:45] subscribing to our Channel without
[00:46] further Ado we go straight at it and
[00:49] show you the first strategy Larry
[00:51] Connor's double seven trading strategy
[00:53] however we rephrase it to double five
[00:56] trading strategy Connors originally used
[00:58] seven trading days in the settings but
[01:01] we only use five days to get more trades
[01:03] when the close is above the 200-day
[01:05] moving average and closes at a five-day
[01:08] low we buy we sell when the close is at
[01:11] a five-day High the rules are simple and
[01:13] the produce the following Equity curve
[01:15] as shown on the screen our modified
[01:17] strategy produces more trades than
[01:19] Connor's original strategy 352 in total
[01:22] and thus more total profits the average
[01:25] gain per trade is 0.65 percent and the
[01:28] drawdowns are moderate at Max 14 and
[01:31] they are short-lived we'd like to
[01:33] mention that the strategy works on a
[01:34] wide range of stock ETFs and Futures but
[01:37] they tend to be correlated let's go to
[01:39] the second Larry Connor's strategy Larry
[01:42] Connors multiple days up and multiple
[01:44] days down strategy we buy when the close
[01:46] is above the 200-day moving average the
[01:49] close must be below the five-day moving
[01:50] average and must have dropped at least
[01:52] four days out of the last five trading
[01:54] days we sell when the close is higher
[01:57] than yesterday's high the equity curve
[01:59] for S P 500 is sloping upwards with an
[02:03] average gain per trade of 0.55 percent
[02:06] and an annual return of four percent the
[02:10] latter is not that high but the strategy
[02:12] is invested only 10 of the time again
[02:15] because we use the 200-day moving
[02:17] average to filter a bullish environment
[02:19] the max drawdown is only 13
[02:22] our third Larry Connor's strategy has
[02:25] the cryptic name of percent B strategy a
[02:27] name to derived from the Bollinger band
[02:29] indicator percent B is an indicator that
[02:32] measure where the close is relative to
[02:34] the upper and lower Bollinger Bands as
[02:36] indicated on the chart we use a five-day
[02:39] lookback period and two standard
[02:41] deviations for the Bollinger Bands when
[02:44] the close is in the lower range of the
[02:45] indicator it signals a buying
[02:47] opportunity opposite it signals a
[02:50] potential good exit when it's in the
[02:52] high end of the range the calculation of
[02:55] percent B is shown on the screen and it
[02:57] resembles the IBS indicator an indicator
[03:00] we have covered in a separate video and
[03:02] is perhaps the most useful indicator for
[03:04] stocks the rules for buying is when the
[03:07] percent B is lower than 0.2 for the
[03:10] third consecutive day and the close is
[03:13] above the 200-day moving average we sell
[03:16] when the close is higher than
[03:17] yesterday's high the equity indicates
[03:19] it's not many trades only 55 for S and P
[03:23] 500 but the few trades make an average
[03:26] gain per trade of almost one percent
[03:28] and the win rate is 87 which is very
[03:31] respectable considering that the average
[03:33] winners and losers are about the same
[03:35] size however time spent invested is very
[03:38] low at 2.5 percent let's go to our
[03:41] fourth Larry Connors strategy which is
[03:43] called the R3 trading strategy the r
[03:46] stands for the relative strength
[03:48] indicator abbreviated RSI the trading
[03:51] rules of the R3 strategy is simple the
[03:54] close must be above the 200-day moving
[03:57] average to make sure we are in a bullish
[03:59] Trend the two-day RSI must have fallen
[04:01] for three days in a row and today's
[04:03] value must be below 20. we sell when the
[04:06] two-day RSI rises above 70. with these
[04:10] rules we get a steady Rising Equity
[04:12] curve for S P 500 but there are only 94
[04:15] trades but those 94 trades have very few
[04:19] losers the win rate is 88 and the
[04:22] average gain per trade is 1.16 the
[04:26] strategy has a market exposure of only
[04:29] 4.57 percent meaning you spend 95
[04:32] percent of the time in cash ready for
[04:34] other complementary strategies let's go
[04:36] to our fifth strategy this one is called
[04:39] RSI 30 and RSI 50 and is obviously based
[04:43] on the relative strength index we have
[04:45] modified the trading rule somewhat but
[04:47] we enter a position when the close is
[04:50] above the 200-day moving average and the
[04:52] 5-day RSI must be below 30. we sell when
[04:57] the 5-day RSI crosses above 50. the
[05:00] rules might be simple but the strategy
[05:02] has performed well and managed annual
[05:05] returns of 6.1 percent despite being
[05:08] invested less than 12 percent of the
[05:10] time
[05:10] if we divide the annual return of 6.1
[05:13] percent by the time invested in the
[05:15] market we get a risk-adjusted return of
[05:18] almost 52 percent this is yet another
[05:21] strategy with a high win rate and the
[05:23] winners are even slightly bigger than
[05:25] the average loser
[05:27] let's present our sixth and last
[05:28] strategy three-day high low strategy
[05:32] the close must be above the 200-day
[05:35] moving average and both today's high and
[05:37] low must be lower for the third
[05:39] consecutive day
[05:40] this last strategy also trades
[05:43] relatively seldom but it still manages
[05:45] an acceptable return 3.6 percent
[05:49] we think that's decent because you spend
[05:51] most of the time on the sidelines the
[05:53] average gain per trade is almost 0.8
[05:56] percent and yet again we have a solid
[05:58] win rate of 79 and Low Max drawdown of
[06:02] only 14 we have now covered six improved
[06:05] Larry Connor strategies what can we
[06:08] learn from them what are the main
[06:09] takeaways our first lesson is that mean
[06:12] reversion strategies have worked well
[06:14] for S P 500 and stocks it has paid off
[06:17] to buy the dip it has been like this
[06:20] since 1985 but of course we don't know
[06:22] how long it will continue the second
[06:25] main takeaway is that the 200-day moving
[06:27] average works well to lower Max
[06:29] drawdowns it's a very good filter to
[06:31] separate Bull and Bear markets something
[06:33] the next video shows when we explain the
[06:36] 200-day moving average strategy Max
[06:38] drawdown for all six strategies is only
[06:41] 14 and all drawdowns don't last long we
[06:44] recover fast from A Loss this is good
[06:47] because it makes it easier to trade and
[06:49] faith in the systems because we are less
[06:51] exposed to trading biases third you
[06:54] might be tempted to trade the systems
[06:56] with Futures instead of ETFs we
[06:58] backtested only spy the ETF that tracks
[07:01] S P 500 but we assume the strategies
[07:04] work well for futures however it's
[07:07] crucial you back test yourself the
[07:09] fourth takeaway is that the strategies
[07:11] stay most of the time on the sidelines
[07:13] thus you can trade other strategies as
[07:16] well to increase Market exposure can you
[07:19] trade all six strategies as a portfolio
[07:21] unfortunately that is not a good idea
[07:24] thus the fifth lesson is perhaps the
[07:27] most important one you can't trade all
[07:30] six strategies as a portfolio of
[07:32] strategies because they are pretty
[07:33] similar and doesn't complement each
[07:35] other well if we trade all six
[07:38] strategies as one portfolio the average
[07:40] return is 6.3 percent and we still are
[07:43] invested only 23.8 percent of the time
[07:45] the win ratio is high at 76 percent but
[07:49] the average winning trade goes down and
[07:51] the losing trades become worse as a
[07:53] portfolio of strategies that's all for
