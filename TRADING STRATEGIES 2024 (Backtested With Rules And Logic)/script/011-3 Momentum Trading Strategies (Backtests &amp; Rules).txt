[00:00] today we show you three momentum trading
[00:02] strategies complete with trading rules
[00:04] and back tests without further Ado we go
[00:07] straight at it and show you the first
[00:09] strategy
[00:11] today's first strategy has the following
[00:13] trading rules
[00:14] when the close crosses above the 100-day
[00:17] high of the close we go long at the
[00:19] close
[00:20] when the close crosses below the lowest
[00:22] close in the last hundred days we sell
[00:24] the clothes
[00:26] we backtest the strategy on S P 500 from
[00:29] 1960 until today
[00:31] however before we show you the results
[00:33] please be advised that nothing in this
[00:36] video is investment advice
[00:38] okay let's get back to our 100 day
[00:40] momentum strategy which shows decent
[00:42] returns
[00:44] our starting capital of 100 000 grows to
[00:46] 5.5 million after 60 years which is 6.5
[00:50] percent annually please keep in mind
[00:53] that the result does not include
[00:54] dividends and with dividends the result
[00:56] is probably around 8.5 percent
[01:00] there are only 41 trades but the
[01:02] strategy is almost kept up with Buy and
[01:04] Hold despite spending just 69 percent of
[01:07] the time in the market thus resulting in
[01:09] solid risk-adjusted returns
[01:11] one benefit of spending less time in the
[01:14] market is risk and drawdown which is the
[01:16] drop from a peak in your equity
[01:18] the momentum strategy keeps you out of
[01:21] major bear markets and Max drawdown is
[01:23] only half of buy and holds as you can
[01:26] see the risk adjusted return crushes Buy
[01:29] and Hold
[01:30] let's go to our second momentum strategy
[01:32] for the day
[01:34] the second momentum strategy is a bit
[01:36] similar to the first one but is slightly
[01:38] changed and best used for assets that
[01:40] typically experience huge price spikes
[01:43] from time to time
[01:44] Bitcoin is an example of such an asset
[01:47] we buy when Bitcoin sets a new 25-day
[01:50] high of the close and we sell when the
[01:53] close is lower
[01:55] the starting capital of a hundred
[01:57] thousand grows to 3.6 million of course
[01:59] part of this is explained by the
[02:01] phenomenal rise of the Bitcoin price
[02:03] however the strategy is only invested
[02:05] 13.9 percent of the time and the
[02:08] performance is still not far behind Buy
[02:10] and Hold
[02:11] this results in solid risk-adjusted
[02:14] returns and low drawdowns
[02:16] let's go to our third and last strategy
[02:19] for today this is a more complex
[02:21] strategy because it involves four
[02:23] different assets it's a sector rotation
[02:25] momentum system that uses monthly bars
[02:28] and momentum to determine which asset to
[02:30] own the next month
[02:32] we use four different assets and ETF to
[02:35] perform the back test spy for S P 500
[02:38] TLT for long-term treasuries EFA for
[02:42] developed stock markets including USA
[02:45] and eem for emerging markets
[02:47] we consider this the most important
[02:49] asset for the stock market and we throw
[02:52] in treasury bonds to add a certain
[02:53] degree of Safe Haven when markets are
[02:55] tough the trading rules are very simple
[02:58] at the end of the month we rank all four
[03:00] assets based on performance over the
[03:02] prior three months and we buy the one
[03:04] with the best performance from then on
[03:06] rinse and repeat every month
[03:09] simple rotation momentum strategy is
[03:11] performed well but has slowed down over
[03:13] the last six years one hundred thousand
[03:16] invested in 2002 is grown to almost 1.4
[03:19] million which equals an annual return of
[03:21] 13.1 percent
[03:23] that's impressive and the drawdown is
[03:26] also most likely acceptable for most
[03:28] investors at 34 percent also the returns
[03:31] are not very correlated to the stock
[03:33] market with the exception of 2022 when
[03:35] both bonds and stocks collapsed
[03:38] we've now shown you three different
[03:40] momentum strategies
[03:42] probably understood by now that a
[03:44] momentum strategy is different than a
[03:46] mean reversion strategy our next video
[03:48] coming up because you buy strength not
[03:50] weakness our examples show that momentum
[03:54] works and this is also proven by plenty
[03:56] academic research let's discuss settings
[03:59] rules and time frames for momentum
[04:01] strategies what are the best settings
[04:03] for a momentum strategy research shows
[04:06] that momentum works best by looking at
[04:08] the performance of the last 3 to 12
[04:09] months a continuation of the momentum
[04:12] tends to continue 3 to 12 months ahead
[04:15] for all other periods momentum works
[04:17] less well
[04:19] which markets work best with momentum
[04:21] strategies momentum is proven to work
[04:23] for most asset classes even the stock
[04:25] market however there are never any
[04:28] strict rules in the market you need to
[04:30] back test yourself and find out what's
[04:32] worked or not in the past and use that
[04:34] as a guideline what is the best time
[04:36] frame momentum strategies again it
[04:38] varies but for stocks momentum works
[04:41] best between 3 to 12 months but for
[04:43] other assets it might work on different
[04:45] time frames for example daily or weekly
[04:48] bars it might even work for day trading
[04:50] strategies at certain assets but day
[04:53] trading is a lot more difficult than the
[04:55] other time frames in our opinion
[04:57] how do you succeed with momentum Trading
[05:00] the best momentum strategy is one that
[05:02] is back tested and traded for many
[05:04] months in a demo account also you can
[05:06] add indicators and combined momentum
[05:08] with other indicators and ideas one
[05:10] example is using momentum with a monthly
[05:12] time frame but using daily bars to enter
[05:15] at a pullback
[05:16] the most important to succeed is that
[05:18] you backtest for example by using a
[05:21] standalone trading platform or by coding
[05:23] in Python
[05:25] that's all for today about momentum
[05:27] trading but please check our website if
[05:29] you're intrigued we have hundreds of
[05:31] trading strategies to be inspired by
[05:34] our next video is about mean reversion

[05:43] you like our material or perhaps have a
[05:45] momentum strategy of your own to share
