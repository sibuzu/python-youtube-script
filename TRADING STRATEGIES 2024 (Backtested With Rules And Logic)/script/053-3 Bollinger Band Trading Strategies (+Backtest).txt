[00:29] explosive moves time your entries and
[00:32] ride Trends in the market
[00:33] welcome to Quantified strategies
[00:36] in this video we are going to show you
[00:38] how to use the Bollinger Bands one of
[00:40] the most popular trading indicators and
[00:42] used by Traders all around the world
[00:44] Bollinger Bands are used to identify
[00:46] Trends measure volatility and find
[00:49] potential breakouts in the market the
[00:51] bands can also be used for mean
[00:53] reversion strategies as you will learn
[00:55] there are many ways you can use the
[00:57] indicator we will dive into a few
[00:59] practical trading techniques that we
[01:00] hope can help you improve your results
[01:02] and take your trading to a higher level
[01:04] we also present you a very profitable
[01:06] Bollinger band mean reversion strategy
[01:08] for S P 500 at the end of the video to
[01:12] understand Bollinger Bands you need to
[01:14] know that they have three components the
[01:16] middle band which is a simple end day
[01:18] moving average for example 10 days on
[01:20] both sides of the moving average there
[01:22] are two bands the upper and lower bands
[01:24] which are X standard deviations away
[01:26] from the mean normally two standard
[01:28] deviations standard deviation is a
[01:31] statistical measure of how much the
[01:32] price deviates from the average and it
[01:34] helps to measure volatility when the
[01:36] bands are widening it means volatility
[01:38] is picking up and it's shrinking when
[01:40] the bands get tighter
[01:42] the bands can also be used to find
[01:43] overbought and oversold conditions but
[01:46] it doesn't necessarily mean that the
[01:47] market will reverse immediately
[01:50] one of the typical mistakes Traders make
[01:52] is blindly shorting or going long just
[01:54] because the price is at the outer band
[01:56] without considering the trend
[01:58] let's look at a back test to illustrate
[02:00] our point and test the following
[02:01] strategy
[02:03] when the share price closes two standard
[02:05] deviations below the 10-day average we
[02:08] go long
[02:09] we exit when it crosses above the 10-day
[02:11] average
[02:12] applied to S P 500 the equity curve
[02:14] looks like this and this is not a very
[02:16] inspiring curve
[02:18] the sharp drops in value make this
[02:20] strategy untradable in our opinion
[02:22] let's look at another way to use
[02:24] Bollinger Bands The Squeeze let's talk
[02:27] about a Bollinger band squeeze
[02:29] one other way to use Bollinger Bands is
[02:31] by paying attention to the Bollinger
[02:32] band squeeze which occurs when the bands
[02:34] get Tighter and Tighter indicating that
[02:36] the Market's volatility is shrinking in
[02:39] the blue rectangle we can clearly see
[02:41] that the bands shrink because volatility
[02:43] drops what does this mean this might
[02:46] indicate an explosive move is about to
[02:48] happen at least that is the theory we
[02:50] backtested many variations of a
[02:52] Bollinger band squeeze and we didn't
[02:54] find it much useful no matter the asset
[02:56] we looked on the equity curve shows the
[02:58] best asset and that was on Pepsi Cola
[03:00] which managed an annual return of 12.5
[03:03] percent slightly below Buy and Hold
[03:05] however this was among the best we could
[03:08] find
[03:09] how about timing your entries
[03:12] another way to use Bollinger Bands is by
[03:14] timing your entries better when the
[03:16] market is trending John Bollinger its
[03:18] inventor argued the bands tend to retest
[03:20] the moving average in the middle before
[03:22] continuing in the direction of the trend
[03:24] as indicated on the chart we have not
[03:27] back-tested this method of using the
[03:28] Bollinger Bands though because of the
[03:30] slightly complex rules needed to be used
[03:33] next part in this video is about writing
[03:35] Trends one other way to use Bollinger
[03:38] Bands frequently mentioned on blogs and
[03:40] social media is by writing Trends in the
[03:42] market
[03:43] for example you can buy a breakout from
[03:46] the upper band and stay in the trade
[03:47] Until It Breaks below the lower band
[03:50] this way you can increase your chances
[03:52] of making significant profits but does
[03:54] it work
[03:55] let's back test it to find out we use
[03:58] the trading rules on the screen and we
[04:00] backtest S P 500 from 1960 until today
[04:04] we get the following result
[04:06] it's only 81 trades since 1960 and you
[04:09] get four percent annual returns by being
[04:11] invested 56 of the time
[04:13] the bonus is that you have the drawdowns
[04:15] compared to buy and hold to only 26
[04:17] percent
[04:18] our final back test of the day is
[04:20] slightly different but we include it to
[04:22] show you a very good Bollinger band
[04:24] strategy that is based on mean reversion
[04:26] we use a five-day moving average and
[04:28] reduce the bands to 1.5 standard
[04:30] deviations we buy on weakness when S and
[04:33] P 500 closes below the lower band and we
[04:36] sell on a day with strength when the
[04:38] close ends higher than yesterday's high
[04:39] hence this is a Bollinger band mean
[04:42] reversion strategy since 1993 this
[04:46] strategy has performed well as the
[04:47] equity curve indicates the annual return
[04:50] is nine percent which is just half a
[04:52] percent lower than Buy and Hold despite
[04:54] being invested only 25 percent of the
[04:56] time
[04:57] there are 500 trades since 1993 and the
[05:00] average gain per trade is 0.5 percent
[05:03] for being invested five trading days per
[05:05] trade the win rate is 76 percent and
[05:08] thus the strategy is pretty accurate
[05:10] advantages and disadvantages of using
[05:12] Bollinger Bands
[05:14] as with any trading indicator the
[05:16] Bollinger Bands have its pros and cons
[05:17] also what are some common mistakes that
[05:20] Traders make when using Bollinger Bands
[05:22] the biggest Advantage is that the bands
[05:24] are easy to understand and interpret and
[05:26] gives a clear understanding of the
[05:28] volatility it might also indicate future
[05:30] Trend directions and as you saw in our
[05:32] last back test we used Bollinger Bands
[05:35] to create a very good strategy however
[05:37] if you are making trading rules based on
[05:39] the upper and lower bands you might get
[05:41] large drawdowns as with any indicator
[05:44] one size doesn't fit all every asset is
[05:47] different and you might need to use
[05:49] Bollinger differently on for example
[05:50] Commodities compared to stocks
[05:53] we believe the biggest mistake is that
[05:55] Traders are looking for trading rules
[05:56] that fit all asset classes but you can
[05:59] expect this to work because assets move
[06:01] and behave differently
[06:02] are there different types of Bollinger
[06:04] Bands and how do they differ from each
[06:06] other
[06:07] here are some examples of alternative
[06:09] bands
[06:10] percentage Bollinger Bands Bollinger
[06:12] bandwidth and double Bollinger Bands
[06:15] we will not go into details about these
[06:17] in this video
[06:18] we also frequently get asked about how
[06:20] Traders can use Bollinger Bands in
[06:22] conjunction with other technical
[06:23] indicators the answer is yes that might
[06:26] be a good idea
[06:27] but as always we recommend back testing
[06:30] your idea to find out if your idea works
[06:32] or not so there you have it three
[06:35] practical trading techniques to help you
[06:37] master Bollinger Bands and improve your
[06:38] results remember don't blindly short or
[06:41] go long just because the price is at the
[06:43] outer band without considering the trend
[06:45] you should always back test your ideas
