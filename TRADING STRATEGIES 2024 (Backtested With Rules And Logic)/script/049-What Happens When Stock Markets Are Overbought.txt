[00:00] unlocking the secret to stock market
[00:02] success requires an understanding of the
[00:04] concept of overbought in this video
[00:06] we'll show you why you must understand
[00:08] this concept what it means and what kind
[00:10] of return can you expect when the stock
[00:12] market is considered overbought stay
[00:14] tuned and we'll answer all in this video
[00:16] first to navigate the Market's
[00:18] complexities you must grasp the
[00:20] principle of mean reversion the main
[00:22] principle to understand the term
[00:23] overbought in statistical terms this
[00:26] means that strong deviations from the
[00:28] trend will eventually revert to the mean
[00:29] and move in the opposite direction when
[00:32] we say weaker we mean in comparison to
[00:34] the previous period so what exactly is
[00:36] overbought it's when the market has
[00:38] experienced a defined period of growth
[00:40] which could be days weeks or months the
[00:42] exact duration is up to you but it's
[00:44] crucial to have a clear definition if
[00:46] you use a daily time frame in trading
[00:48] for instance a period of 15 days could
[00:50] be considered overbought depending on
[00:52] how much it Rose during that time at
[00:55] Quantified strategies we like to rely on
[00:57] numbers to illustrate our points
[00:59] therefore we will use the RSI indicator
[01:01] to prove our Point by formulating a
[01:03] trading strategy to identify overbought
[01:05] conditions hopefully with this knowledge
[01:08] you can make more informed investment
[01:09] decisions and Achieve greater success in
[01:11] the market let's find out what happens
[01:13] when the stock market is overbought we
[01:16] back test we make the following trading
[01:18] rules one we buy S P 500 at the close
[01:21] when the two-day RSI is above 95. two we
[01:24] sell at the close after end days this is
[01:27] a simple strategy but we make it simple
[01:29] to prove our point the relative strength
[01:31] indicator RSI is used because it goes
[01:34] from oversold to overbought conditions
[01:36] constantly and it measures the velocity
[01:38] of those moves when values are high it
[01:41] indicates an euphoric Market as it has
[01:43] risen a lot over the defined look back
[01:45] period our back test is summarized in
[01:47] this table the First Column shows when
[01:49] we exit Row one exiting after one day
[01:52] row after two days and so on column
[01:54] three shows that the returns in the
[01:56] first five days after entry are
[01:58] significantly lower than the long-term
[02:00] average which is about zero zero five
[02:02] percent per day however as time goes on
[02:04] the returns gravitate toward the
[02:06] long-term averages as expected so to
[02:09] conclude our back Test shows that we can
[02:11] expect lower returns in the short term
[02:13] than average after reaching an
[02:14] overbought condition that's all for
[02:16] today thanks for tuning in and we'll see
[02:18] you in the next one and by the way don't
