[00:00] which Trader isn't dreaming about
[00:01] nailing bottoms and tops so-called
[00:03] reversal days
[00:05] anecdotal observations on social media
[00:07] suggests that activity goes up when
[00:09] something breaks but how realistic is it
[00:11] to capture reversals
[00:13] in this video we'll be discussing and
[00:15] back testing reversal day strategies
[00:16] both bullish and bearish so stay tuned
[00:19] we start by making trading rules for a
[00:21] bullish reversal day today's low is
[00:24] lower than yesterday's low today's close
[00:26] is higher than yesterday's close
[00:28] the five-day RSI must be lower than 35.
[00:31] the green arrows in the chart show when
[00:33] we buy and the Red Arrows show the exit
[00:35] after five days let's find out the
[00:38] trading statistics for the strategy
[00:40] we used our platform's Optimizer
[00:42] function in exit after 1 to 25 trading
[00:44] days in Gold GLD
[00:46] we got the following statistics the
[00:49] First Column tells us the day we exit
[00:50] for example row 24 indicates that the
[00:54] highest average gain per trade is when
[00:56] we exit after 24 trading days which is
[00:58] 2.02 percent
[01:00] overall column 4 shows that the profit
[01:03] factor is pretty good for almost all
[01:05] exits but it's not many trades
[01:07] if we exit after one day the equity
[01:09] curve looks like this let's flip the
[01:12] rules for a potential bearish reversal
[01:13] day strategy
[01:15] today's high is higher than yesterday's
[01:17] high today's close is lower than
[01:19] yesterday's close the five-day RSI must
[01:22] be higher than 65. the green arrows show
[01:25] when we buy and the Red Arrows indicate
[01:27] the exit after five days again to find
[01:30] the trading metrics we use the
[01:31] platform's optimizer function and got
[01:33] the following table in Gold GLD the
[01:36] bearish reversal day shows positive
[01:38] returns but significantly less than the
[01:40] bullish reversal day the conclusion
[01:42] seems to be that the bullish reversal
[01:44] day holds up well while the bearish
[01:46] reversal day less so
[01:48] however we backtested the gold price and
[01:51] it has a long-term upward bias that
[01:53] makes it hard to trade from the short
[01:55] side
[01:55] this and a lot more are the kind of
[01:58] strategies that we provide to
[01:59] subscribers
[02:00] code courses and a lot more will also be
[02:03] available on our website please check it
[02:06] out if you think this is something for
[02:07] you that's all for today if you like
