[00:10] you one trading strategy that shows the
[00:12] potential of the indicator as shown by
[00:15] the curve you see on the
[00:17] screen first what is the relative Vigor
[00:20] index and what does it
[00:22] indicate the relative Vigor index is a
[00:24] technical indicator that measures the
[00:26] momentum of price Movement by comparing
[00:28] the closing price to its trade range it
[00:31] uses a simple moving average to smooth
[00:33] the results called the signal line it is
[00:36] based on the tendency of the price to
[00:37] close higher than it opens in an uptrend
[00:40] and close lower than it opens in a
[00:43] downtrend how is the relative volatility
[00:46] index
[00:47] calculated to calculate the relative
[00:49] Vigor index you need to follow a
[00:51] four-step process first calculate the
[00:55] numerator second calculate the
[00:58] denominator third you calculate the
[01:01] rvi and finally you end the process by
[01:05] calculating the signal line now let's
[01:07] show you a relative Vigor index trading
[01:09] strategy we back tested the relative
[01:12] Vigor index on GLD the ETF tracking the
[01:15] gold price and the results are pretty
[01:17] good the trading rules are simple yet
[01:19] effective we use a 5-day lookback period
[01:22] and we buy GLD when the rvi crosses
[01:25] above the signal line we also add a
[01:27] second condition the 5-day RS I of the
[01:30] relative Vigor index must be below 50 we
[01:33] sell when the signal line crosses above
[01:35] the rvi the results are pretty good and
[01:38] there are many trades the average gain
[01:41] per trade is
[01:42] 0.44% and the win rate is a moderate
[01:46] 51% however the winners are on average
[01:49] much bigger than the average
[01:51] losers does the strategy work on other
[01:54] assets no it doesn't work well on the
[01:57] S&P 500 or bonds for example however
[02:00] that doesn't mean the strategy is
[02:01] curve-fitted all assets move differently
