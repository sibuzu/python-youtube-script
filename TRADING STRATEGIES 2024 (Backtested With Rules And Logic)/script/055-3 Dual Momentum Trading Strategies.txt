[00:00] welcome to Quantified strategies and in
[00:03] this video we show you three dual
[00:05] momentum trading strategies complete
[00:07] with trading rules settings and
[00:08] historical performance
[00:10] show you what a dual momentum trading
[00:12] strategy is we look at historical
[00:14] performance and show you how you can
[00:16] implement it yourself
[00:18] we show you dual momentum between stocks
[00:21] and bonds dual momentum between stocks
[00:23] and gold and the famous dual momentum
[00:26] strategy by Gary antonacci the last
[00:29] strategy is the best one so we recommend
[00:30] staying until the end
[00:32] by the way we're always working hard to
[00:35] create new and exciting content so your
[00:37] likes and subscriptions really help us
[00:39] out thanks
[00:41] let's show you the trading rules of the
[00:44] first of the three dual momentum trading
[00:46] strategies it trades S P 500 and
[00:48] long-term treasury bonds we use the ETFs
[00:51] with the ticker codes spy for S P 500
[00:54] and TLT for treasury bonds
[00:57] the trading rules and settings are very
[00:59] simple at the end of every month buy the
[01:02] ETF that has performed the best over the
[01:04] last three months percentage-wise
[01:06] that's it rinse and repeat every month
[01:09] momentum has historically worked best
[01:11] between 3 and 12 months hence the
[01:13] setting of three months this is a
[01:15] momentum strategy but we can also call
[01:17] it a sector rotation strategy for
[01:20] example if today's the end of June you
[01:22] buy the asset that's performed the best
[01:23] since the close of March
[01:25] the equity curve shows that 100
[01:28] 000 invested in 2003 is worth nine
[01:30] hundred and twenty thousand today but
[01:32] performance has been weak after 2020.
[01:35] the annual return of 11.5 percent is
[01:38] high how much better than buy and hold
[01:40] each of the two ETFs and Max drawdown is
[01:43] also significantly lower at 30 percent
[01:45] the worst drawdown happened in 2022 when
[01:48] both stocks and bonds suffered a major
[01:50] bear Market something that's not
[01:52] happened often in the past before that
[01:54] drawdowns were moderate and short in
[01:57] duration
[01:58] there are only two losing years 2015 and
[02:01] 2022 but the majority of the years had
[02:03] double-digit growth
[02:05] let's go to the second dual momentum
[02:07] strategy this one trades S P 500 and
[02:10] gold and we use the ETFs with e-ticker
[02:13] codes spy and GLD
[02:16] this dual momentum trading strategy is
[02:19] similar to the first one except that we
[02:21] swap TLT for GLD we use a three-month
[02:24] look back period to measure momentum and
[02:26] we go long the asset with the best
[02:28] percentage performance over the last
[02:29] three months and we rinse and repeat
[02:31] going forward
[02:33] the strategy is performed well 100 000
[02:36] invested in 2005 is worth nine hundred
[02:38] twenty thousand today which is an annual
[02:40] return of 12.8 percent
[02:43] you're invested on average five months
[02:46] in an ETF and the max drawdown is 34
[02:48] which is much better than spy's 55
[02:51] drawdown
[02:53] however if we zoom out and look at the
[02:55] longer time Horizon the strategy is not
[02:58] performed so well
[02:59] it was not until 2005 the strategy
[03:02] started working really well but part of
[03:04] this is explained by the very poor
[03:06] performance of gold for almost two
[03:07] decades after 1980.
[03:10] let's show you the third and last dual
[03:12] momentum trading strategy Gary Anthony's
[03:15] dual momentum Gary Anthony published the
[03:18] Dual momentum strategy in his book dual
[03:21] momentum investing which he released in
[03:23] 2015 and this is a trend following
[03:26] strategy
[03:27] the trading rules are a bit more complex
[03:29] than the first two it trades three
[03:31] different assets U.S stocks foreign
[03:33] stocks excluding U.S stocks and bonds
[03:36] for our back test we use the following
[03:39] ETFs spy EFA and AGG
[03:43] let's look at the trading rules at the
[03:46] end of every month rank all three ETFs
[03:48] based on the performance over the last
[03:50] 12 months if bonds performed better than
[03:53] spy then you buy bonds and hold it for
[03:55] the next month if spy perform better
[03:58] than bonds then you buy the best
[04:00] performing ETF of spy and EFA
[04:03] then you rinse and repeat at the end of
[04:05] every month
[04:06] Gary antonacci backtested the strategy
[04:09] back to 1950 and it's outperformed
[04:11] massively with substantially lower
[04:13] drawdowns the table shows that Gary
[04:16] Anthony's dual momentum strategy
[04:18] performed four percentage points better
[04:20] annually that's a massive outperformance
[04:23] can you expect this to continue or is
[04:26] this a curve fitted strategy
[04:28] let's find out how it's performed after
[04:30] the strategy was published we coded the
[04:32] trading rules into our trading platform
[04:34] and back tested it 100 000 invested in
[04:37] 2004 is worth 328 000 today which is a
[04:41] rather lackluster 6.1 percent per year
[04:44] something which is significantly below
[04:46] the long-term average of the strategy
[04:48] one of the reasons is the huge drawdown
[04:51] in 2022 of almost 30 percent the
[04:54] drawdown was moderate during the
[04:56] financial crisis in 2008 there was
[04:58] nowhere to hide in 2022 when both stocks
[05:01] and bonds crashed this happens often
[05:03] when you're back testing the worst
[05:05] drawdown is yet to come
[05:07] we've shown you three dual momentum
[05:09] trading strategies but none in this
[05:11] video is investment advice always make
[05:13] sure you do your own research that fits
[05:15] your investment goals
[05:17] we'll now answer a few frequently asked
[05:19] questions about dual momentum trading
[05:21] strategies please also have a look at
[05:23] our next video coming up about three
[05:25] momentum trading strategies
[05:28] what's the main advantage of dual
[05:29] momentum strategies
[05:31] momentum is an anomaly that's existed
[05:33] for as long as we have stock market data
[05:36] of course that's not guaranteed to
[05:38] continue into the future but we believe
[05:40] one of the explanations for the anomaly
[05:42] is that we tend to chase winners and
[05:44] human nature is slow to change
[05:46] what's the best time frame for dual
[05:48] momentum trading strategies
[05:51] research suggests that look back periods
[05:53] between 1 and 12 months have worked best
[05:55] historically as long as the look back
[05:57] period is within that range and the
[05:59] holding period is within that range
[06:01] you're likely to find something that
[06:02] works
[06:03] for example if a stock or asset is
[06:06] outperformed over the last six months
[06:07] you can backtest its performance for the
[06:10] next one to six months thus momentum
[06:12] investing has proved to work best in the
[06:14] past on monthly bars
[06:16] what are the different types of momentum
[06:19] trading strategies
[06:20] there are two types of momentum trading
[06:22] relative momentum and absolute momentum
[06:26] is a dual momentum trading strategy easy
[06:28] to implement we would argue that this is
[06:31] one of the easiest types of strategies
[06:33] to implement all you need is free data
[06:36] to back test the strategy on and then go
[06:38] on to check quotes once a month or less
[06:40] when you trade it live
[06:42] however easy to implement doesn't mean
[06:44] easy money
[06:46] there's no easy money in the markets
[06:49] do you need to time the market with a
[06:51] dual momentum trading strategy no that's
[06:54] one of the advantages with this type of
[06:56] trading and investing as Warren Buffett
[06:58] known as the Oracle of Omaha once wisely
[07:00] stated trying to time the mark it is the
[07:03] number one mistake to avoid
[07:05] spending time and energy predicting the
[07:07] optimal moments to buy or sell in the
[07:09] market is exceedingly challenging and
[07:11] mostly futile often resulting in missed
[07:13] opportunities or premature actions as
[07:16] Peter Lynch once said far more money has
[07:18] been lost by investors trying to
[07:20] anticipate Corrections then lost in the
[07:23] corrections themselves
[07:24] however dual momentum offers a potential
[07:27] Solution by providing a method to
[07:29] identify and capitalize on trends
[07:32] is dual momentum the same as sector
[07:34] rotation
[07:36] in practice yes but a sector rotation
[07:39] trading strategy might also be based not
[07:41] only on momentum but also other types
[07:43] for example mean reversion
[07:46] are there any disadvantages with dual
[07:48] momentum trading strategies
[07:56] hopefully have a profit Prof and thus
[07:57] might be liable to capital gains taxes
[08:01] you better have a tax deferred account
[08:03] another disadvantage might be curve
[08:05] fitting a strategy might work
[08:07] exceptionally well with a three-month
[08:09] look back period but perform a lot worse
[08:11] with a one or six month period
[08:14] would you trust a setting of three
[08:16] months if this is the case
