[00:00] is it possible to make profits during a
[00:02] religious holiday some might say it's
[00:04] disrespectful to even consider trading
[00:06] during Ramadan but the stock market
[00:08] doesn't take a break so what if we told
[00:10] you that there is a trading strategy
[00:12] that works during this holy month join
[00:14] us as we explore the Ramadan holiday
[00:16] trading strategy and its performance in
[00:19] the stock market Ramadan is a Muslim
[00:20] holiday and dates change every year in
[00:22] the Gregorian calendar for example in
[00:25] 2022 Ramadan started on the 1st of April
[00:28] and finished on the 1st of May while in
[00:30] 2023 it started on the 22nd of March and
[00:33] will end the 21st of April countries
[00:35] such as Saudi Arabia turkey and Egypt
[00:37] are among many that celebrate this
[00:39] holiday in this video we follow the
[00:41] lunar calendar like the Sunni Muslims
[00:43] let's find out the stock market's
[00:45] performance during Ramadan if the
[00:47] holiday starts on a weekend we buy S P
[00:50] 500 on Monday we use the same principle
[00:52] when we sell the returns look decent but
[00:55] not spectacular the annual return at 1.1
[00:58] percent is slightly more than Buy and
[01:00] Hold considering the less time spent
[01:02] invested which is eight percent however
[01:04] it is impossible not to notice that the
[01:07] returns from 2008 till today have been
[01:09] very poor is the performance better in
[01:11] Muslim countries Saudi Arabia turkey and
[01:14] Egypt are among the biggest countries
[01:16] celebrating this holiday we decided to
[01:18] put this Theory to the test and back
[01:20] test the same strategies using ETFs from
[01:23] these countries which have the ticker
[01:25] code KSA egpt and 2R as you can see the
[01:29] strategy does not perform well in these
[01:31] countries either with a flat performance
[01:32] over the last 15 years that's all for
[01:35] today our Ramadan strategy is just one
[01:37] of many hundreds of strategies we
[01:39] present on our website please check them
