[00:03] would you like to make money in
[00:05] strategies that are invested less than
[00:07] 24 hours in this video we'll show you a
[00:10] strong positive trading Edge in gold and
[00:12] the gold minor sector it happens from
[00:15] the close until the open the next day
[00:18] let's show you how this chart shows the
[00:21] equity curve of GDX the ETF that tracks
[00:24] gold miners when you're invested from
[00:26] the close until the next open the upward
[00:29] slope is pretty
[00:30] stable opposite if you buy at the open
[00:33] and sell at the close the same day you
[00:36] lose money likewise we see the same
[00:38] pattern in GLD the ETF that tracks the
[00:41] gold price this chart shows the gains
[00:44] from the close until tomorrow's open the
[00:47] gains have beaten by and hold because
[00:49] the return from the open to the close
[00:51] have been slightly negative the
[00:53] overnight Edge is not big enough to be
[00:55] tradable on its own but it's an edge and
[00:58] a great starting point if you add one or
[01:00] two other variables you might have
[01:02] something that works for example we made
[01:05] the following gold overnight strategy
[01:07] for GL by adding two
[01:09] variables the strategy shows a rising
[01:12] slope and has been consistent for almost
[01:14] two decades these are the kind of
[01:17] strategies that we provide to our paying
[01:19] subscribers so please have a look at our
