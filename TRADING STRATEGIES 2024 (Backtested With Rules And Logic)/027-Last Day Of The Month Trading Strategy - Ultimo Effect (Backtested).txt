[00:00] in today's video we'll explain one of
[00:02] the best and oldest trading strategies
[00:04] albeit not common to
[00:06] Traders before we explain the trading
[00:09] strategy called the turn of the month
[00:10] strategy you can go through our other
[00:12] videos to get insight on numerous
[00:14] trading strategies and tips to help you
[00:16] rake in more profit while
[00:19] trading the end of the month effect is
[00:21] not new to Traders and financial
[00:23] professionals alike in one of our recent
[00:25] videos we mentioned this phenomenon
[00:26] citing it as an anomaly in this video
[00:29] we'll EXP explain how to use this
[00:31] anomaly to your advantage when trading
[00:33] the end of the month is a seasonal
[00:35] pattern in trading that occurs at the
[00:36] end of every month where stocks tend to
[00:38] rally for a few days while the end of
[00:41] the month effect is common what's not
[00:43] common about it is this effect spills
[00:45] over to about 2 to 3 days into the new
[00:47] month this is why it's called the turn
[00:49] of the month effect and not the end of
[00:51] the month effect this effect while
[00:54] largely unimportant in the general sense
[00:56] to analysts can be attributed to salary
[00:58] payments balance B ing of records and
[01:00] accounts businesses and an increase in
[01:03] the amounts of funds poured into savings
[01:05] at the end of every month hence the
[01:07] rallying of stocks this is what makes it
[01:10] profitable to invest at the end of the
[01:12] month the turn-of the month strategy
[01:14] helps for high performance in the
[01:16] markets it's so much better that it
[01:18] beats the usual Buy and Hold strategy
[01:20] even with a lower exposure time here are
[01:23] the rules of this trading strategy we
[01:25] buy the S&P 500 on the close of the
[01:28] fifth trading day of the month and sell
[01:30] on the close of the third day of the
[01:32] following month here's a chart that
[01:34] highlights these
[01:35] rules the Green Arrow indicates where
[01:38] and when we get into the trade the Blue
[01:40] Link indicates the first day of the new
[01:42] month and the red arrow indicates the
[01:44] exit or selling point by leveraging the
[01:47] turn-of the month effect portfolio
[01:48] profit all month every month moreover
[01:51] you only trade for 7 days a month
[01:53] freeing you up to take up other
[01:55] activities that's every Trader's dream
[01:57] to spend less time and earn more money
[02:00] if you're wondering what else makes this
[02:02] method better than the Buy and Hold
[02:04] strategy here it is it comes out in an
[02:07] annual return of
[02:08] 7.1% a notable difference to using the
[02:11] Buy and Hold strategy which tops out at
[02:14] 6.9% for the same amount of time or more
[02:17] also the draw Downs are different when
[02:19] compared with Buy and Hold strategy
[02:20] topping out at minus 56% while the
[02:24] turn-of the month strategy hits minus
[02:26] 27% you can check out the chart below
