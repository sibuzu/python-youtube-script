[00:00] despite being much larger than the stock
[00:02] market the bond market gets much less
[00:04] attention from short-term Traders that's
[00:06] a shame because bonds are great trading
[00:08] Vehicles this article will provide you
[00:10] with four specific bond trading
[00:12] strategies we'll explore bonds and argue
[00:15] why you should trade bonds bonds are a
[00:17] great trading tool because they are
[00:19] complementary to stock trading
[00:21] strategies so let's get started
[00:23] first is bond trading profitable that
[00:26] depends on the strategy you need to back
[00:29] test and verify your strategies before
[00:30] you commit money and this includes the
[00:33] examples in this video we provide no
[00:35] investment advice
[00:37] second what is a bond when a bond is
[00:40] issued by a company or sovereign state
[00:42] the borrower receives funds from
[00:44] investors which are lenders the borrower
[00:46] promises to pay interest on a fixed
[00:48] schedule for a specific duration and to
[00:50] repay the principal when the bond
[00:52] reaches maturity and the capital is
[00:54] returned to the lenders thus a bond is
[00:57] different than a share of a company in
[00:59] case of bankruptcy bondholders are paid
[01:02] before shareholders and thus bonds are
[01:04] less risky than stocks also Shares are
[01:07] generally deemed riskier than bonds
[01:08] because swings in price are more severe
[01:11] thus bond trading should be less risky
[01:14] than stock trading because of less risk
[01:16] bonds have not performed as well as
[01:18] stocks however there are different types
[01:21] of bonds municipal bonds government
[01:23] bonds corporate bonds junk bonds Etc
[01:27] the bonds are not equal for example some
[01:30] junk bonds behave muck like stocks and
[01:32] are the exception government bonds are
[01:34] the safest thus we regard bonds as safer
[01:37] than stocks in this article we only look
[01:40] at long-term U.S treasury bonds what
[01:42] makes the price of bonds move that
[01:44] depends on credit risk interest rate
[01:46] risk and inflation risk when interest
[01:48] rates go up the price of the bond goes
[01:50] down
[01:51] why would you trade bonds and is bond
[01:54] trading profitable
[01:55] treasury bonds for example are less
[01:57] volatile than stocks but the advantage
[01:59] of investing in them is that they
[02:01] typically have a low correlation with
[02:03] stocks making them a complementary asset
[02:06] class in the chart the red line shows
[02:09] the 25-day rolling correlation between S
[02:11] and P 500 and long-term U.S treasury
[02:14] bonds while the black line represents
[02:17] the 200-day moving average as shown the
[02:20] correlation fluctuates over time but the
[02:22] black line remains close to the blue
[02:24] line which indicates zero indicating a
[02:27] lack of correlation let's look at some
[02:29] bond trading examples with specific
[02:31] trading rules
[02:33] although the following strategies have
[02:34] been back tested using the ETF that
[02:37] tracks 20-year treasury bonds the ticker
[02:39] code is TLT it might be possible to use
[02:42] the corresponding Futures Contract
[02:44] provided that you adhere to the same
[02:46] official trading hours as TLT
[02:49] our first bond trading strategy was
[02:51] published a few years ago on our website
[02:53] but it has performed well since then
[02:55] the trading rules are simple we buy on
[02:58] the seventh last trading day of the
[02:59] month and we sell at the close of the
[03:02] month this simple seasonal strategy has
[03:05] worked well and has shown a reasonably
[03:07] steady rise in the equity curve the
[03:09] annual return is 5.45 Which is higher
[03:13] than Buy and Hold including dividends
[03:15] reinvested this is not bad for being
[03:17] invested only 28 of the time
[03:20] but there is a new twist to the strategy
[03:22] let's make a second back-tested strategy
[03:25] at the end of the month we reverse our
[03:27] bond position and go short and we cover
[03:30] at the close of the seventh last trading
[03:32] day of the month again we see a steady
[03:35] rise in our Equity even though TLT has
[03:37] risen During the back-tested period our
[03:40] short position made 4.41 annually
[03:42] despite TLT Rising 4.6 percent
[03:46] short is very difficult to trade in both
[03:48] bonds and stocks so this is a very good
[03:50] result
[03:51] let's now combine both strategies to
[03:53] make our third strategy we buy TLT at
[03:56] the seventh last trading of the month
[03:57] and we sell and reverse to short at the
[04:00] end of the month we cover the short
[04:02] position on the seventh trading day of
[04:04] the new month when we combine the
[04:06] strategies the result obviously improves
[04:08] one hundred zero zero zero grows to
[04:12] 735000 over the 20-year period We
[04:16] Believe seasonal patterns are one of the
[04:18] lowest hanging fruits in trading the
[04:20] strategy has crushed by and hold you're
[04:23] invested only 61 percent of the time and
[04:26] you still get a 10.25 annual return
[04:29] which is over double Buy and Hold even
[04:32] better the short position has worked
[04:34] well the best part is that this result
[04:36] is most likely non-correlated to stock
[04:38] market returns if we employ the last
[04:40] combined strategy on S P 500 we get
[04:43] Negative returns this is a strong
[04:45] indication you might want to diversify
[04:47] your strategies to other assets than
[04:49] stocks let's now look at the fourth Bond
[04:52] strategy it's a long Bond strategy where
[04:54] we buy TLT based on two variables One
[04:57] Price action variable and one seasonal
[04:59] variable we exit the position on
[05:02] strength as you can see it has performed
[05:04] well
[05:05] the 227 trades had an average gain of
[05:10] 0.44 which equals 4.8 percent annual
[05:14] returns
[05:15] also please notice the Low Max drawdown
[05:18] from an equity Peak we are not revealing
[05:21] the trading rules because it's part of
[05:22] our membership program the four
[05:24] strategies are examples of how you can
[05:26] make money trading bonds but one of the
[05:29] main reasons for including bonds is
[05:31] diversification they are complementary
[05:33] to many other assets let's show you an
[05:36] example of our membership strategies the
[05:38] equity curve shows the return of three
[05:40] different S P 500 strategies combined
[05:43] into one portfolio of strategies the
[05:46] average gain per trade is 0.7 percent
[05:49] and the annual unleveraged return is
[05:52] 11.5 percent
[05:54] this is good but we can improve it by
[05:56] adding bond trading strategies to the
[05:58] mix by incorporating complementary bond
[06:01] trading strategies the annual returns
[06:03] rise from 11.5 percent to 19.2 percent
[06:07] while also reducing drawdowns however
[06:10] there is no guarantee that the future
[06:12] replicates the past
[06:14] nevertheless our video demonstrates that
[06:16] Bond strategies provide diversification
[06:18] to a portfolio
[06:20] furthermore integrating bond trading
[06:22] strategies might decrease drawdowns
[06:24] stocks might be more profitable than
[06:27] bonds but combining them is the most
[06:29] rational thing a Trader can do
[06:31] coming up is a video about three mean
[06:33] reversion strategies in the stock market
[06:35] that can provide you with some trading
[06:37] ideas that's all for today and don't
[06:40] forget this is no investment advice
