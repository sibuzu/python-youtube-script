[00:00] howdy howdy Traders today we have
[00:01] something truly exciting in store for
[00:03] you we'll be sharing a trading strategy
[00:05] that I think you will be interested in
[00:07] and excited about this particular
[00:09] strategy is designed to not only
[00:11] minimize your losses during bear markets
[00:13] but also maximize your gains and bullish
[00:15] ones at the end of the video we are also
[00:18] sharing an additional system that will
[00:20] complement this one perfectly but first
[00:22] in this video we'll be taking a closer
[00:24] look at the well-known Golden Cross
[00:26] indicator and sharing our back testing
[00:28] results on the S P 500 before we dive in
[00:31] let's take a step back and make sure
[00:33] we're all on the same page what exactly
[00:36] is the Golden Cross indicator the Golden
[00:38] Cross is a chart pattern in which a
[00:40] short-term moving average crosses above
[00:42] a long-term moving average typically the
[00:45] Golden Cross uses the 50-day moving
[00:47] average as the short-term moving average
[00:49] and the 200-day moving average as the
[00:51] long-term moving average we are going to
[00:53] use this in our example today but why
[00:55] would you use the Golden Cross indicator
[00:57] well the stock market tends to be in a
[00:59] long-term uptrend due to inflation and
[01:01] productivity gains and the Golden Cross
[01:03] strategy aims to exploit this upward
[01:06] bias while reducing losses in Bear
[01:08] markets in fact the Golden Cross can
[01:10] help you stay out of a major bear market
[01:11] and while the strategy is prone to
[01:13] whipsaw signals the few Big Winners can
[01:15] make up for it so how do you use the
[01:17] Golden Cross indicator the rules are
[01:19] simple when the 50-day moving average
[01:21] crosses above the 200-day moving average
[01:23] it signals a bullish breakout and you
[01:26] buy conversely when the 50-day moving
[01:28] average crosses below the 200-day moving
[01:31] average it signals a bearish breakout
[01:33] and you sell your position let's take a
[01:35] look at a trade example in this example
[01:37] the 50-day a moving average broke above
[01:39] the 200-day moving average signaling a
[01:42] bullish breakout you could have bought
[01:43] the S P 500 in July 2020 at 28.67 and
[01:47] ridden the trend until you sold in March
[01:49] 2022 at 41.73 for a nice 32.4 percent
[01:54] gain of course not all trades turn out
[01:56] this well but how does the Golden Cross
[01:58] strategy perform over the long term we
[02:01] backtested the strategy on the S P 500
[02:03] since 1960 and you can see the full
[02:05] trade list here the strategy primarily
[02:08] involves minimal activity resulting in a
[02:10] small number of Trades specifically 32
[02:12] in total each trade is held for
[02:14] approximately 350 days we found that 78
[02:18] percent of the trades were winners with
[02:20] an average trade gain of 15.4 percent
[02:22] and an annual return of 6.6 percent
[02:24] while this doesn't beat buy and hold's
[02:27] annual return of 6.9 percent we have to
[02:29] consider that our strategy was only
[02:31] invested 69 percent of the time however
[02:33] the Golden Cross strategy had
[02:35] substantially lower drawdowns compared
[02:37] to buy and hold with only a 33 drawdown
[02:40] versus buy and holds 56 percent thus the
[02:43] risk-adjusted return is better at 9.5
[02:46] percent which we calculated by dividing
[02:48] the annual return of 6.6 by the time
[02:51] spent in the market 0.69 so there you
[02:54] have it a powerful trading strategy that
[02:56] can help reduce your losses in Bear
[02:58] markets and ride the bull markets if you
[03:00] want to know the code we use for this
[03:02] strategy you can find that and hundreds
