[00:00] in today's video we present a strategy
[00:02] that is invested only during specific
[00:04] trading days of the month but still has
[00:06] beaten by and hold over the last 60
[00:08] years before we explain the strategy we
[00:11] remind you that our web page is a
[00:12] treasure Trove of the best trading
[00:14] strategies out there with free resources
[00:16] available for any time frame you're
[00:18] interested in
[00:19] we have backtested hundreds of
[00:21] strategies just like the one you'll
[00:23] learn about in this video
[00:25] so what is the strategy all about it's
[00:28] about a seasonal pattern that has
[00:29] existed for decades the strategy is
[00:31] based on the fact that stocks tend to
[00:33] Rally in the last days of the month and
[00:35] the first three days of a new month
[00:37] let's go to the trading rules we buy S P
[00:40] 500 on the fifth last trading day of the
[00:42] month and we sell on the third trading
[00:44] day of the new month as shown in the
[00:46] chart the Green Arrow shows when we buy
[00:49] the Blue Line marks the first trading
[00:51] day of the new month and the red arrow
[00:53] is when we sell
[00:55] by being invested only seven trading
[00:57] days per month we get the following
[00:59] Equity curve
[01:01] as you can see the equity grows linearly
[01:04] all the time
[01:05] the annual return is seven percent which
[01:08] is more than buy and hold of 6.9 percent
[01:10] the Fantastic result happens despite the
[01:13] fact that the strategy is only invested
[01:15] 33 of the time
[01:17] because you spend most of the time on
[01:19] the sidelines the drawdowns are also
[01:21] much smaller at 27 versus 56 for Buy and
[01:25] Hold
[01:26] to better illustrate the difference we
[01:28] made a chart that shows the ride for our
[01:30] strategy compared to being invested all
[01:32] the time
[01:33] clearly the red line shows less bumps
[01:35] along the way can the strategy be
[01:38] improved yes it can we made some changes
[01:41] to the trading rules and we improved the
[01:43] strategy and reduced the time invested
[01:45] in the market from 33 to 23 while still
[01:48] making 6.7 annual returns
[01:51] however the trading rules are only for

[01:55] strategy monthly for a small fee
