[00:00] today we're going to talk about the
[00:01] carry trade strategy and what it is so
[00:04] for example in Forex it involves
[00:06] borrowing in a currency with a low
[00:09] interest rate and you convert that
[00:12] borrow amount into another currency with
[00:14] a higher interest rate so the main idea
[00:18] is to make money on the interest rate
[00:19] differential and to make money you need
[00:22] lots of Leverage but as we know leverage
[00:26] can backfire because here as you can see
[00:28] this is the Japanese Yen and the dollar
[00:31] currencies can actually move a lot
[00:34] so a typical carry trade it has many
[00:37] small big Winners and a wrap like here
[00:40] and a random big losers so we can uh we
[00:46] can say that this is a negatively skewed
[00:48] distribution this is what Nasim taleb
[00:51] would call tail risk because it's prone
[00:53] to random shocks
