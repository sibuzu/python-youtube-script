in 2009 Meb Faber and Eric W Richardson
released a book called Ivy portfolio
which outlines an investment strategy
that seeks to replicate the performance
of a basket of endowments such as those
of ivy league universities for example
yales ivy league universities have
consistently outperformed the market
over time due to their Diversified
portfolios and long-term investment
Horizon an Ivy League portfolio consists
of a mix of stocks often about 60% an
intermediate Bond allocation of 20% and
the rest in
Commodities historically such a
diversified portfolio has performed well
the inflation adjusted return is above
4% with a standard deviation below that
of the S&P 500 perhaps the returns won't
set the world on fire but the portfolio
is obtained exactly what it was supposed
to
do just give it time and it'll snowball
how can you set up an IV portfolio
yourself we made a portfolio of five
ETFs that we believe are close to
achieving the same return as any ivv
portfolios we use the five ETFs that you

allocation of
20% how is such an IV portfolio of ETFs
performed we back tested it from
2008 the annual return is 4.6% which is
significantly below the historical
average and this is mainly due to the
abysmal performance of
Commodities most years are positive but
the financial crisis in 2008 made the
portfolio drop 45% at the
maximum if you like our video please
